## 1. Set the reference pocket, put the content in later
```
(Object) (name)
(name) = (value/construction)
```
- Line 1 reserves the slot and defines its name, but has no content (yet)
- Line 2 Creates the values it must contain and assigns it to a name
- Why you would do this idfk
	- I GUESS if you need the name reserved for a return statement where the program... idk, returns the value and your function doesn't have a default value to defer to it if it doesn't do its thing. 

## 2. Set the value and name in place
```
(Object type) (name) = (value/construction)
```
- THE BETTER METHOD
- Takes the type, takes the name, creates a value/constructs
-
