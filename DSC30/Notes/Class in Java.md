- Class - Object template
	- Must have a "main" function to run, "Indicates where to start"
- Object - Instance of a Class
- A instantiates B - A is class, B is Baby, A made B

## Parts of a Class

- Instance Variable - Variables used to make the Instance, any amount, defined.
- Constructor - Same name as Class, actual blueprint of a Class
- Non-Static (Instance) Method - Describes class actions. Must use instance object, can't just be class blueprint itself.

## Constructor Overload
- Creating multiple constructors for the same object, all taking different inputs.
	- Good for generalized use cases, where a troglodyte might have all the answers.
