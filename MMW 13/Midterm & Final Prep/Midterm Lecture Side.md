# Lecture 1 - Course Themes
Focus of lecture:  
1) The origin and impact of the “Rise of the West” mythology  
2) Towards a more inclusive, polycentric narrative of “world history”?  
## “Rise of the West” Master Narrative  
The Myth of European Exceptionalism  
- Eurocentric “world historians” assumed that Western culture inherently unique, intrinsically exceptional  
	- Distinguished by change, innovation, rationality, entrepreneurship  
- Posited a binary opposition of paralysis vs. dynamism between East and West  
	- Conceded that prior to 15th century, medieval Europe too had been steeped in religious fatalism—seeing this world as “vale of tears”  
	- But that from the 15th century on, Europe began to shed this ideology of renunciation for a belief in the infinite potential of human agency  
		- Insisting that “only in the West” does one find a spirit of...  
- Yet begs the question: Was the rest of the world EVER mired in the same type of   religious dogmatism that had paralyzed medieval Europe?  

Sources of this Myth of European Exceptionalism  
- 19th century European historians attributing the largely uncontested global supremacy of European imperialism to some “inherent historical necessity”  
- Denial of “Coevalness”  
	- Assumption that historical change does not factor into other cultures’ past  
- Diffusionist Theory—West “pulled” other cultures out of their static past  

How Historical Perspective Impacts the Future  
- If we take a more objective and inclusive view of what the world was like before European colonial hegemony  
- If we “begin the story early enough” as Janet Abu-Lughod puts it, it makes all the difference  

## Explanations for “The Rise of the West”  

David Buck’s “Was it Pluck or Luck that Made the West Grow Rich?”  
- “Pluck” as in the instinct, knack, or propensity inherent in European culture that propelled the West to economic prominence by the 18th century  
- "Luck” as in unanticipated, non-premeditated global contingencies, accidents,   serendipity that allowed the West to stumble upon its good fortune  

David Landes’s “European Exceptionalism” argument  
- “Rise of the West” due to Europe’s unique cultural heritage  
- Europe had all the characteristics of an “inventive” civilization  
	- Risk-taking, entrepreneurial spirit, worldly rationality  

Andre Gunder Frank “Historical Discontinuity” argument  
- Europe’s success represents an anomaly in its political and economic evolution  
- More a “discontinuity” than a pre-ordained “inevitability”  

R. Bin Wong’s “Separate Trajectories” argument  
- No shared or universal “meta-narrative” for what “progress” means
	- Important to “go beyond asking European-derived questions,” such as “Why did China fail where Europe succeeded?”  
- Contingency, Accident, Conjuncture  
	- Contingency: Every new phenomenon is conditioned by earlier developments  
	- Accidents: Unpredictable events beyond short term human control  
	- Conjuncture: Independent local developments collide or intersect to shape the course of history

# Lecture 2 - The Mongol Conquests
Focus of lecture:  
1) Contingent factors behind the short-lived but consequential Mongol empire  
2) Global consequences and legacy of this phenomenon  

## I) Age of the Nomad  

Extent of Mongol Empire  
- Area conquered in three short generations starting from 1206  
- All without modern communications, transport, or weapons—How?  

Military Advantages  
- Warrior-based society
	- Men under 60 were expected to fight
	- No salary, but split of spoils
	- Use of Tribal "Retirement Fund" to provide for over 60
- Fighting skills and strategies  
	- Skilled riders with effective use of the short composite bow and the nerge
		- Focus on light armor, horseback, and long range, hit-and-run strategies
	- No shame in retreat—in fact, used it as a battle strategy
		- Bait and encirclement
	- Use of hunting tactics like the nerge to encircle the enemy  
		- Nerge - encirclement, surrounding the enemy, hunting roots
	- Use of banners and drums to coordinate rapid movement
		- Resulted in smaller than actuality armies
	- Effective use of siege-craft
		- Did not invent them, but recruited best engineers for innovation
	- Terror as a strategy of warfare
		- Committing atrocities to resistant cities, leaving survivors to tell the tale
			- *Aura Farming?*

Climate Change and Patterns of Nomadic Behavior Prior to 1200
- David Ringrose’s on effects of climate change (Expansion and Global Interactions)
	- Significant warming trend from 800-1200 C.E.
		- Demographic effects on a global scale
			- Due to warmer climate = more agricultural spots = more farmers
		- “Buffer zone” between nomads and farmers shrank significantly as a result
			- Resulted in more tensions between the cultures
- Nomad Incursions from 11th to 12th century  
	- As such, by early 1200s, Genghis Khan perhaps simply integrating what other nomad regimes had already set up?  
## II) “The Accidental Empire”  
Conquerors by default  
- Mongol expansion under Genghis Khan not by design but by default  
- Their intent always to follow the traditional “outer frontier strategy”  

*Mongol Strategy: Outer Frontier Strat*
- *Fight*
- *Loot*
- *Take concessions*
- *Run back to the steppes*
- *I.e. Harassing,*

Problem with “Outer Frontier Strategy” for the Mongols  
- But late 1100s, Mongols had to face semi-nomadic rulers who now occupied the fertile regions  
	- Jurchens had established the Jin (Chin) Dynasty in northern China  
		- Former Manchurian Nomads, Had their own formidable cavalry to match the Mongols.
			- Mongols had to fight hard and long to get any resources.
			- War of attrition ended up destroying basis of productivity in northern China.
				- *Over 90 cities razed, Population (and farmers) drops from 50 million to 8 million*
				- *So, where could any concessions even come from*
			- In western Asia, faced defiance of Turkic nomad rulers, such as Khwarazm Shah 
				- Resulted in all-out punitive expedition by Genghis khan in 1219

Motive Behind Mongol Expansion  
- Punitive retaliation without restraint  
- Ignored the simple equation: When you destroy something completely, you leave nothing from which to extract concessions and wealth 

Reluctant administrators of land they conquered by default  
- Initially saw peasants as dispensable and farmland as an eyesore
- E.g. Ogodei Khan’s initial plan was to turn all of northern China into pasture
	- Each mongol, has about 10 or so horses to carry luggage, YURT, spoils, etc
	- Infinite pasture? INFINITE BEES
	- Advisor suggested taxing farmers instead
## III) The Impact of the Mongol Empire  
Religious Pluralism  
- Integrated empire facilitated the spread of religious systems  
	- Religion had the means to transcend ethnic and cultural barriers  
	- E.g. presence of William of Rubruck and later of the Polos in Mongol court 
	- Chabi - Kublai Khan's fav wife, Christian

Economic Coherence  
- Provided secure and efficient infrastructure for trade  
	- Insurance against the aggression of other nomads against caravans  
	- Tendency for nomadic rulers to favor commerce  
- Mongol measures to facilitate trade  
- 1250-1350: A truly global network

# Lecture 3 - Mongols In China / The Yuan Dynasty
Key Questions:  
1) What challenges did the nomadic Mongol rulers face in managing a sedentary, multi-  
ethnic society like that of China?  
2) How did they try to overcome them?

## Khubilai Khan: From Nomad to Emperor of China  
The Four Khanates  
- After Genghis khan’s death in 1227, empire divided into four administrative regions  
	- To the West—Il-khans in Persia (Hulegu overthrew the Abbasids in 1258)  
	- To the Northwest—The Golden Horde in Russia (Berke)  
	- Central Asia—Khanate of Chagatai  
	- To the East—Great Khanate in Mongolian heartland and China (Khubilai)  

Khubilai’s Rise to Power  
- Elected Great Khan after his older brother died suddenly in 1260  
- Challenged by another younger brother Arigh Boke  
- Between 1260-1264, costly and lengthy campaigns to suppress this challenge  
	- Victory derived from controlling food from Arigh Boke as opposed to any battle
	- Needed to re-invent himself into a committed sovereign of a sedentary society

Economic Recovery under Khubilai  
- Devastation of northern China from previous wars  
- Emergency measures  
	- Establish Office for the Stimulation of Agriculture in 1261
	- Ended tax farming and pro-farming relief policies
	- Autonomous village organizations called she
- Records show Khubilai to be a well-informed, hands-on executive  
	- Resourceful, pragmatic in use of advisors of all faiths and ethnicities
		- As well as recruiting of advisors and workers, choosing confucian and buddhist, christians, anyone with expertise.
	- Delegated responsibility broadly so as to avoid reliance on one group  

Boost commercial infrastructure  
- Support for the Muslim-run merchant associations—known as ortakhs  
	- Financial middle-men—funding from Mongol elites -> loans to merchants
		- So as to redirect social burden and stigma of "debt collecting"
		- Also shifted blame to merchants for conversion into currency
			- *See "Paper Currency"*
	- Enjoyed laissez-faire policy via low taxes and tarrifs
- Paper currency  
	- All merchants had to convert gold or silver to paper currency  
	- Why inflation did not get out of hand  
- Postal Stations or Yambs  
	- System first set up by Ogodei Khan  
	- 25 miles apart/ 200 to 400 fresh horses at the ready  
	- About 50k horses for message relay
## The Making of a “Global” Sovereign  
A “global” and cosmopolitan sovereign with pragmatic sensibilities  
- Appreciation for not just the symbolism but the function of diversity  
- Recruited and used talented experts from the entire Mongol realm  
	- E.g. Jamal al-Din and Kuo Shou-ching, his Chinese counterpart  
	- E.g. Yeh-hsi-tieh-erh, Muslim architect, to lead construction of Da-du  
	- E.g. The Case of the Polos  
- Had an almost modern awareness of the power of image-making  
	- For him to succeed, he had to hold a dual image for both of his empires
	- Dual identity as the Great Khan of the Mongols, but also as the Yuan emperor of his Chinese subjects. 

Establishment of the hierarchy of four ethnic classes
- Mongols, Semuren, Hanren, Nanren  

Heavy Reliance on Foreign Administrators
- Despite distrust for subjects, the skill impressed the Mongols enough to assign them positions
- The Case of Ahmad  
	- Finance czar from 1262-1282  
	- Strong, Draconian fiscal measures he took to increase Yuan court revenue
		- Increased amount of registered households
		- Skilled at picking out imperial concubienes for leader Khan
- The Case of Saiyid Ajall  
	- Appointed governor of strategic new territory of Yunnan in 1274  
	- Why choose an old Muslim for such a key post?
		- 
	- Achievements as governor  

The Adverse Impact of Global Politics on Mongol-Muslim Relations  
- Geopolitical developments in 1270-1280 affecting domestic policy  
	- Threat of Islamic power  
	- Anti-Muslim decrees or jasaghs  
	- Later reversed for Muslim merchants in 1287
- Was this the cumulative effect of anti-Muslim sentiments in China?  
	- E.g. Christian official Ai-xue’s relentless sabotaging of Muslims  


## Lecture 4 - Expeditions in the Ming Dynasty
Key Points:  
1) The origin and purpose of the Ming Treasure Fleet  
2) Geopolitical impact of the Ming assertion and withdrawal of maritime power  
## The Mongol Expansionist Legacy for the Ming Dynasty  
Mongol expansionist policy circa. late 13th Century
- Khubilai Khan’s unsuccessful attempt to control southeast Asia  
- The ill-fated naval invasion of Japan in 1281
	- In one case, 140k man fleet destroyed by "kamikaze"
- Collapse of Yuan Dynasty beginning in 1320s  
- *Appearance of the Bubonic Plague in China*
- Establishment of the Ming Dynasty by the mid-1300s  

Continuation of expansion under Ming Emperor Yongle (1402-1424)  
- “Out and out militarist”  
	- Lengthy expeditions north and south  
	- Assertion of maritime power in Southeast Asia and Indian Ocean  
- Mongols: Integration of economic network across Eurasia
- Ming: Integration of maritime network in Indian Ocean

Rationale for the Treasure Fleets of the Ming  
- Size of the fleet  
	- 300 Vessels
- Size of the largest “Treasure Ships” Bao Chuan
	- Nine masts, 400 fleet in length; +/- 3000 tons capacity?
	- 5 Ties the size of Columbus' *Santa Maria*
## The Legacy of Zheng He and the Treasure Fleet  
Personal Background  
- Muslim of Arab and Mongol ancestry from Yunnan province  
- Recruited for eunuch training at 10 and castrated
- Why did Emperor Yongle choose a Muslim eunuch to lead the fleet?
	- Useful status as an outsider - Outside of Confucian ideas of internal agriculture as opposed to expedition, and therefore, able to be trusted with Yongle's ideas and ideals. 
	- Eunuch Status - Most defiled, unable to go to Mecca

The Purpose of the Treasure Fleets (1402-1435)  
- Extend Chinese maritime presence  
	- Military: Suppressing piracy for the sake of securing trade routes  
		- “To cleanse and pacify the sea routes”  
	- Cultural: Extending cultural embassies to demonstrate imperial prestige  
		- “Unifying the seas and continents” beyond even Han and Tang
	- Commercial: Aside from revenue, demonstrate largesse and wealth  
	- Political: Powerbroker and “kingmaker” in regional politics  
		- Overall, 47 new tributary states were added as the result of the expeditions  
		- Paternalistic logic of tributary system
			- Tributary System - Not Colonized, instead have to annually give the Chinese court a tribute to show subservience
	- “Transforming power of imperial virtue (and magnanimity)”  
- Ming fleet’s “carrot and stick” approach  
	- Dazzle with its wealth and size, intimidate with massive firepower  
	- Profound geopolitical impact throughout southeast Asia and Indian ocean  

Extent of expeditions  
- Each expedition went progressively farther  
	- First two: Malacca, Sumatra  
	- 3rd reached Malabar coast  
	- 4th reached the Red Sea and Hormuz  
	- Later expeditions reached East African coast—Mogadishu and Mombasa
	- Did they go beyond that?
- Gavin Menzies’s theory concerning 6th Expedition 1421-1423
	- 1421: The Year China Discovered America  

Confucian Backlash  
- Death of Emperor Yongle in 1424  
- Seventh and last expedition in 1435 during reign of Emperor Xuande  
- The Destruction of a Legacy  
	- Entire fleet scrapped and left to ruin  
	- Archives of previous expeditions totally destroyed in 1477  
- Economic Retrenchment in late Ming  

Impact on World History Past and Present  
- Crucial “contingency” for subsequent European entry into Indian Ocean  
- Relevance for China’s foreign policy today  
	- Recent propaganda to revive and celebrate the legacy of Zheng He  
	- Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative
