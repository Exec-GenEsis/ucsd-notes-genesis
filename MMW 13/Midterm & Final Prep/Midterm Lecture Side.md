# Lecture 1 - Course Themes
Focus of lecture:  
1) The origin and impact of the “Rise of the West” mythology  
2) Towards a more inclusive, polycentric narrative of “world history”?  
## “Rise of the West” Master Narrative  
The Myth of European Exceptionalism  
- Eurocentric “world historians” assumed that Western culture inherently unique, intrinsically exceptional  
	- Distinguished by change, innovation, rationality, entrepreneurship  
- Posited a binary opposition of paralysis vs. dynamism between East and West  
	- Conceded that prior to 15th century, medieval Europe too had been steeped in religious fatalism—seeing this world as “vale of tears”  
	- But that from the 15th century on, Europe began to shed this ideology of renunciation for a belief in the infinite potential of human agency  
		- Insisting that “only in the West” does one find a spirit of...  
- Yet begs the question: Was the rest of the world EVER mired in the same type of   religious dogmatism that had paralyzed medieval Europe?  

Sources of this Myth of European Exceptionalism  
- 19th century European historians attributing the largely uncontested global supremacy of European imperialism to some “inherent historical necessity”  
- Denial of “Coevalness”  
	- Assumption that historical change does not factor into other cultures’ past  
- Diffusionist Theory—West “pulled” other cultures out of their static past  

How Historical Perspective Impacts the Future  
- If we take a more objective and inclusive view of what the world was like before European colonial hegemony  
- If we “begin the story early enough” as Janet Abu-Lughod puts it, it makes all the difference  

## Explanations for “The Rise of the West”  

David Buck’s “Was it Pluck or Luck that Made the West Grow Rich?”  
- “Pluck” as in the instinct, knack, or propensity inherent in European culture that propelled the West to economic prominence by the 18th century  
- "Luck” as in unanticipated, non-premeditated global contingencies, accidents,   serendipity that allowed the West to stumble upon its good fortune  

David Landes’s “European Exceptionalism” argument  
- “Rise of the West” due to Europe’s unique cultural heritage  
- Europe had all the characteristics of an “inventive” civilization  
	- Risk-taking, entrepreneurial spirit, worldly rationality  

Andre Gunder Frank “Historical Discontinuity” argument  
- Europe’s success represents an anomaly in its political and economic evolution  
- More a “discontinuity” than a pre-ordained “inevitability”  

R. Bin Wong’s “Separate Trajectories” argument  
- No shared or universal “meta-narrative” for what “progress” means
	- Important to “go beyond asking European-derived questions,” such as “Why did China fail where Europe succeeded?”  
- Contingency, Accident, Conjuncture  
	- Contingency: Every new phenomenon is conditioned by earlier developments  
	- Accidents: Unpredictable events beyond short term human control  
	- Conjuncture: Independent local developments collide or intersect to shape the course of history

# Lecture 2 - The Mongol Conquests
Focus of lecture:  
1) Contingent factors behind the short-lived but consequential Mongol empire  
2) Global consequences and legacy of this phenomenon  

## I) Age of the Nomad  

Extent of Mongol Empire  
- Area conquered in three short generations starting from 1206  
- All without modern communications, transport, or weapons—How?  

Military Advantages  
- Warrior-based society
	- Men under 60 were expected to fight
	- No salary, but split of spoils
	- Use of Tribal "Retirement Fund" to provide for over 60
- Fighting skills and strategies  
	- Skilled riders with effective use of the short composite bow and the nerge
		- Focus on light armor, horseback, and long range, hit-and-run strategies
	- No shame in retreat—in fact, used it as a battle strategy
		- Bait and encirclement
	- Use of hunting tactics like the nerge to encircle the enemy  
		- Nerge - encirclement, surrounding the enemy, hunting roots
	- Use of banners and drums to coordinate rapid movement
		- Resulted in smaller than actuality armies
	- Effective use of siege-craft
		- Did not invent them, but recruited best engineers for innovation
	- Terror as a strategy of warfare
		- Committing atrocities to resistant cities, leaving survivors to tell the tale
			- *Aura Farming?*

Climate Change and Patterns of Nomadic Behavior Prior to 1200
- David Ringrose’s on effects of climate change (Expansion and Global Interactions)
	- Significant warming trend from 800-1200 C.E.
		- Demographic effects on a global scale
			- Due to warmer climate = more agricultural spots = more farmers
		- “Buffer zone” between nomads and farmers shrank significantly as a result
			- Resulted in more tensions between the cultures
- Nomad Incursions from 11th to 12th century  
	- As such, by early 1200s, Genghis Khan perhaps simply integrating what other nomad regimes had already set up?  
## II) “The Accidental Empire”  
Conquerors by default  
- Mongol expansion under Genghis Khan not by design but by default  
- Their intent always to follow the traditional “outer frontier strategy”  

*Mongol Strategy: Outer Frontier Strat*
- *Fight*
- *Loot*
- *Take concessions*
- *Run back to the steppes*
- *I.e. Harassing,*

Problem with “Outer Frontier Strategy” for the Mongols  
- But late 1100s, Mongols had to face semi-nomadic rulers who now occupied the fertile regions  
	- Jurchens had established the Jin (Chin) Dynasty in northern China  
		- Former Manchurian Nomads, Had their own formidable cavalry to match the Mongols.
			- Mongols had to fight hard and long to get any resources.
			- War of attrition ended up destroying basis of productivity in northern China.
				- *Over 90 cities razed, Population (and farmers) drops from 50 million to 8 million*
				- *So, where could any concessions even come from*
			- In western Asia, faced defiance of Turkic nomad rulers, such as Khwarazm Shah 
				- Resulted in all-out punitive expedition by Genghis khan in 1219

Motive Behind Mongol Expansion  
- Punitive retaliation without restraint  
- Ignored the simple equation: When you destroy something completely, you leave nothing from which to extract concessions and wealth 

Reluctant administrators of land they conquered by default  
- Initially saw peasants as dispensable and farmland as an eyesore
- E.g. Ogodei Khan’s initial plan was to turn all of northern China into pasture
	- Each mongol, has about 10 or so horses to carry luggage, YURT, spoils, etc
	- Infinite pasture? INFINITE BEES
	- Advisor suggested taxing farmers instead
## III) The Impact of the Mongol Empire  
Religious Pluralism  
- Integrated empire facilitated the spread of religious systems  
	- Religion had the means to transcend ethnic and cultural barriers  
	- E.g. presence of William of Rubruck and later of the Polos in Mongol court 
	- Chabi - Kublai Khan's fav wife, Christian

Economic Coherence  
- Provided secure and efficient infrastructure for trade  
	- Insurance against the aggression of other nomads against caravans  
	- Tendency for nomadic rulers to favor commerce  
- Mongol measures to facilitate trade  
- 1250-1350: A truly global network

# Lecture 3 - Mongols In China / The Yuan Dynasty
Key Questions:  
1) What challenges did the nomadic Mongol rulers face in managing a sedentary, multi-  
ethnic society like that of China?  
2) How did they try to overcome them?

## Khubilai Khan: From Nomad to Emperor of China  
The Four Khanates  
- After Genghis khan’s death in 1227, empire divided into four administrative regions  
	- To the West—Il-khans in Persia (Hulegu overthrew the Abbasids in 1258)  
	- To the Northwest—The Golden Horde in Russia (Berke)  
	- Central Asia—Khanate of Chagatai  
	- To the East—Great Khanate in Mongolian heartland and China (Khubilai)  

Khubilai’s Rise to Power  
- Elected Great Khan after his older brother died suddenly in 1260  
- Challenged by another younger brother Arigh Boke  
- Between 1260-1264, costly and lengthy campaigns to suppress this challenge  
	- Victory derived from controlling food from Arigh Boke as opposed to any battle
	- Needed to re-invent himself into a committed sovereign of a sedentary society

Economic Recovery under Khubilai  
- Devastation of northern China from previous wars  
- Emergency measures  
	- Establish Office for the Stimulation of Agriculture in 1261
	- Ended tax farming and pro-farming relief policies
	- Autonomous village organizations called she
- Records show Khubilai to be a well-informed, hands-on executive  
	- Resourceful, pragmatic in use of advisors of all faiths and ethnicities
		- As well as recruiting of advisors and workers, choosing confucian and buddhist, christians, anyone with expertise.
	- Delegated responsibility broadly so as to avoid reliance on one group  

Boost commercial infrastructure  
- Support for the Muslim-run merchant associations—known as ortakhs  
	- Financial middle-men—funding from Mongol elites -> loans to merchants
		- So as to redirect social burden and stigma of "debt collecting"
		- Also shifted blame to merchants for conversion into currency
			- *See "Paper Currency"*
	- Enjoyed laissez-faire policy via low taxes and tarrifs
- Paper currency  
	- All merchants had to convert gold or silver to paper currency  
	- Why inflation did not get out of hand  
- Postal Stations or Yambs  
	- System first set up by Ogodei Khan  
	- 25 miles apart/ 200 to 400 fresh horses at the ready  
	- About 50k horses for message relay
## The Making of a “Global” Sovereign  
A “global” and cosmopolitan sovereign with pragmatic sensibilities  
- Appreciation for not just the symbolism but the function of diversity  
- Recruited and used talented experts from the entire Mongol realm  
	- E.g. Jamal al-Din and Kuo Shou-ching, his Chinese counterpart  
	- E.g. Yeh-hsi-tieh-erh, Muslim architect, to lead construction of Da-du  
	- E.g. The Case of the Polos  
- Had an almost modern awareness of the power of image-making  
	- For him to succeed, he had to hold a dual image for both of his empires
	- Dual identity as the Great Khan of the Mongols, but also as the Yuan emperor of his Chinese subjects. 

Establishment of the hierarchy of four ethnic classes
- Mongols, Semuren, Hanren, Nanren  

Heavy Reliance on Foreign Administrators
- Despite distrust for subjects, the skill impressed the Mongols enough to assign them positions
- The Case of Ahmad  
	- Finance czar from 1262-1282  
	- Strong, Draconian fiscal measures he took to increase Yuan court revenue
		- Increased amount of registered households
		- Skilled at picking out imperial concubienes for leader Khan
- The Case of Saiyid Ajall  
	- Appointed governor of strategic new territory of Yunnan in 1274  
	- Why choose an old Muslim for such a key post?
		- 
	- Achievements as governor  

The Adverse Impact of Global Politics on Mongol-Muslim Relations  
- Geopolitical developments in 1270-1280 affecting domestic policy  
	- Threat of Islamic power  
	- Anti-Muslim decrees or jasaghs  
	- Later reversed for Muslim merchants in 1287
- Was this the cumulative effect of anti-Muslim sentiments in China?  
	- E.g. Christian official Ai-xue’s relentless sabotaging of Muslims  


# Lecture 4 - Expeditions in the Ming Dynasty
Key Points:  
1) The origin and purpose of the Ming Treasure Fleet  
2) Geopolitical impact of the Ming assertion and withdrawal of maritime power  
## The Mongol Expansionist Legacy for the Ming Dynasty  
Mongol expansionist policy circa. late 13th Century
- Khubilai Khan’s unsuccessful attempt to control southeast Asia  
- The ill-fated naval invasion of Japan in 1281
	- In one case, 140k man fleet destroyed by "kamikaze"
- Collapse of Yuan Dynasty beginning in 1320s  
- *Appearance of the Bubonic Plague in China*
- Establishment of the Ming Dynasty by the mid-1300s  

Continuation of expansion under Ming Emperor Yongle (1402-1424)  
- “Out and out militarist”  
	- Lengthy expeditions north and south  
	- Assertion of maritime power in Southeast Asia and Indian Ocean  
- Mongols: Integration of economic network across Eurasia
- Ming: Integration of maritime network in Indian Ocean

Rationale for the Treasure Fleets of the Ming  
- Size of the fleet  
	- 300 Vessels
- Size of the largest “Treasure Ships” Bao Chuan
	- Nine masts, 400 fleet in length; +/- 3000 tons capacity?
	- 5 Ties the size of Columbus' *Santa Maria*
## The Legacy of Zheng He and the Treasure Fleet  
Personal Background  
- Muslim of Arab and Mongol ancestry from Yunnan province  
- Recruited for eunuch training at 10 and castrated
- Why did Emperor Yongle choose a Muslim eunuch to lead the fleet?
	- Useful status as an outsider - Outside of Confucian ideas of internal agriculture as opposed to expedition, and therefore, able to be trusted with Yongle's ideas and ideals. 
	- Eunuch Status - Most defiled, unable to go to Mecca

The Purpose of the Treasure Fleets (1402-1435)  
- Extend Chinese maritime presence  
	- Military: Suppressing piracy for the sake of securing trade routes  
		- “To cleanse and pacify the sea routes”  
	- Cultural: Extending cultural embassies to demonstrate imperial prestige  
		- “Unifying the seas and continents” beyond even Han and Tang
	- Commercial: Aside from revenue, demonstrate largesse and wealth  
	- Political: Powerbroker and “kingmaker” in regional politics  
		- Overall, 47 new tributary states were added as the result of the expeditions  
		- Paternalistic logic of tributary system
			- Tributary System - Not Colonized, instead have to annually give the Chinese court a tribute to show subservience
	- “Transforming power of imperial virtue (and magnanimity)”  
- Ming fleet’s “carrot and stick” approach  
	- Dazzle with its wealth and size, intimidate with massive firepower  
	- Profound geopolitical impact throughout southeast Asia and Indian ocean  

Extent of expeditions  
- Each expedition went progressively farther  
	- First two: Malacca, Sumatra  
	- 3rd reached Malabar coast  
	- 4th reached the Red Sea and Hormuz  
	- Later expeditions reached East African coast—Mogadishu and Mombasa
	- Did they go beyond that?
- Gavin Menzies’s theory concerning 6th Expedition 1421-1423
	- 1421: The Year China Discovered America  

Confucian Backlash  
- Death of Emperor Yongle in 1424  
- Seventh and last expedition in 1435 during reign of Emperor Xuande  
- The Destruction of a Legacy  
	- Entire fleet scrapped and left to ruin  
	- Archives of previous expeditions totally destroyed in 1477  
- Economic Retrenchment in late Ming  

Impact on World History Past and Present  
- Crucial “contingency” for subsequent European entry into Indian Ocean  
- Relevance for China’s foreign policy today  
	- Recent propaganda to revive and celebrate the legacy of Zheng He  
	- Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative
		- 1421: The Year China Discovered America 

# Lecture 5 - Trade Networks in East Africa
Key Focus:  
1) What role did the Swahili coast play in the Indian Ocean network?  
2) What were the features of this littoral culture prior to the Portuguese intrusion?  
3) How did the littoral features of this culture shape its worldview?  

## Myth of the “Dark Continent”  
View of Africa through the Prism of European Colonialism  
- Shaped by 19th century European imperialist imagination  
- Eurocentric perception of a continent empty of civilization and history  
	- Birthplace of human biological evolution, but disregard for historical evolution  
	- e.g. Trimingham: “By adopting Islam, Africa entered into history”  
- Need to recognize Africa’s integral role in the global network of commercial,  
religious, and cultural exchange before European colonialism  

## The Legacy of Swahili Civilization  
“Swahili” as a Geographic Location  
- Reference to coastal region of East Africa spanning over 1200 miles  
- By the 13th century, this “Swahili” region included roughly 40 trading towns  
- Mogadishu in the north, Sofala in the south, and Malindi, Mombasa, Zanzibar, and  

Kilwa in between  
- “Kiswahili” as a Cultural Designation  
	- Language that the people in this region generally spoke  
		- Primarily dialects of the Bantu tongue  
- Ubiquitous presence of Islam due to both immigration and conversion  
	- Indigenization of Islam vs. “Pure” Islam?  
		- Ibn-Battuta’s impressive account of Mogadishu in 1332  

“Swahili” as a Demographic Distinction  
- In general, hybrid of African, Arab, Persian, and Gujarati ethnicities  
	- Quite meaningless to distinguish “foreign” from “local,” “immigrant” from “native” or “us” from “them”  
- The Swahili coast was regarded less as a boundary but more as a gateway  
	- Eclectic, permeable, “macrocosmic” rather than a homogenous, insular “microcosmic” world  
	- Part of an “international trading world,” not a political world  
- Meaning of “littoral”  
	- Literally, “of the coast, shore, or banks”  
		- Figuratively, “littoral” describes a culture that is ever elastic, ever porous, never bounded, never insulated  
	- J.C. Heesterman aptly summed up: “The littoral forms a frontier zone that is not there to separate or enclose, but which rather finds its meaning in its permeability”  
		- “Littoral” vs. “parochial” consciousness—which applies to us today?  
## The Permeability of a Littoral Culture
Polycentric network of Swahili Cities  
- System of reciprocity, of a “niche trade,” rather than hegemony  
	- E.g. Prominence of Mogadishu and Somali cities in the 12th century  
	- Later prominence of Kilwa and southern cities in the 13th century  
	- Kilwa southernmost point to which ocean-faring merchant ships could travel if they wanted to sail home the same year  

The Rhythm of the Winds  
- N.E. Monsoons (Kas Kazi in Swahili)  
- S.W. Monsoons (Kusi in Swahili)  
- Practical implications for trade network  
	- Instead of one people or one city monopolizing trade, each party filled a niche in this highly dynamic, polycentric, and elastic system

# Lecture 7 - Trade Networks in West Africa
Key Focus:  
1) What stimulated trade in West Africa before the European intervention?  
2) What was the extent of wealth and influence in West African kingdoms?

## The Advent of the Trans-Saharan Trade  
Pre-5th century C.E. Scenario  
- Slow and infrequent—relied mostly on pack-oxen  

Transport Breakthrough in 5th century C.E.  
- The Camel Revolution  
	- Able to travel twice as fast and twice as far as pack-oxen  
	- Perfectly adapted to the desert—e.g. sealable nostrils for the ghiblis  
- Role of Berbers—the Sanhaja and the Taureg  

The Mediterranean-Sahel Link  
- “Sahel”—Arabic word for “shore”  
- Network of desert “littoral” cities—Walata, Timbuktu, Gao, Djenne, Kumbi-Saleh  
##  The First West African Kingdom—Ghana (10th to 12th centuries)  
Historical Background  
- Strategically located between Sahara desert and forests of the Niger and Senegal  
- Soninke People with capital at Kumbi-Saleh  
	- Access to iron tools, weapons, and horses from the Mediterranean  
	- Conduit of trade between desert salt mines at Taghaza (Western Sahara) and goldfields of Bambuk (Upper Senegal River)  

The Gold Trade  
- By 8th and 9th centuries, safer, less subject to raids  
	- Wealth of Ghanaian kingdom directly paralleled expansion of trade  
- Soninke position as “middlemen” in this lucrative trade  
	- Tariffs on salt going in and out of Kumbi Saleh  
	- King kept all the gold nuggets—traded gold dust  
- The gold harvesters of Bambuk  
	- Accounts from Al-Bakri, an 11th century geographer of Cordoba  

Kumbi-Saleh in the 11th century  
- Consisted of two towns  
	- One for Muslims, other for the King  
	- Area rich in resources—farming and fishing supported a large population  
- Social Stratification  
	- Royal family did not convert  
	- Trade was only accessible to a small elite group  

Decline of Ghana in 13th Century  
- First, rise of the Almoravids—an extremist Islamic tribe in North Africa 
	- Insisted on their version of Shari-a, started a jihad against locals
	- Interruption of caravans weakened the Ghanaian trade economy  
- Second, environmental duress?
- Last, discovery of new gold fields farther east—Bure  

## The Aura of African Wealth and Power—Mali Empire (13th to 14th Century)

Historical Background  
- Mandinka People—chiefs had converted to Islam as early as 11th century - *al Musalmani*
	- Majority population remained largely polytheists  
- Why no state-compulsion towards conversion?  
	- Economic
		- Converting to Islam might reduce trade opportunities
	- Political
		- Islam conversion can be used as a social barrier for the elites
	- Social factors
		- Not wanting to alienate its people
	- Advantages of elites adopting Islam  
- Like Ghana, thrived on gold trade  
	- Sundyata (r.1230-1255) founder of empire who set up capital at Niani  

Extent of Empire  
- System of vassalage  
- At its peak, 1000 miles across from Atlantic to heart of Africa  
- Possibility of an Atlantic crossing?  

Worldly Prominence under Mansa Musa (r. 1312-1337)  
- Brought a lot of gold as alms for people, feeling it was his duty (100 Camels)
	- When he ran out, started borrowing gold
	- Gave so much gold in Cairo that it started to inflate its economy.
- Famous pilgrimage to Mecca  
- Returned with scholars, architects, poets, scientists  
	- Famous madrasas and libraries at Timbuktu
	-  Great Mosque at Djenne (Recently destroyed by Islamists)
-  Catalan map of 1375
- What Africa symbolized for Iberians in the 14th Century

# Lecture 7 - The Ottoman Empire

Key Focus This Week:  
1) How three empires under Muslim rulers emerged, thrived, and fell into decline  
2) How they managed large communities of non-Muslim subjects in their realm  
3) To what degree did they succeed or fail in addressing challenges of religious pluralism?  
## Dar Al-Islam “The Abode of Islam”  
The Link Between Various Islamic Networks in 13th-14th century  
- Mostly integrated by three emerging Islamic Empires by 1500s  
	- Mughals in India, Safavids in Persia, Ottomans in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Balkans  

## The Rise of Ottomans  
Humble Beginnings  
- Small Turkic tribe ostensibly subservient to the Seljuks of Rum  
- (Person) Osman Bey effectively exploited the rivalry between the Byzantines and Seljuks
	- Martial, Militaristic structure adopted within this timeframe
- By the late 13th century, both major powers had been weakened

Ottoman Expansion  
- By 1300s, conquered Asia Minor and the Balkans (Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria)  
	- Constantinople finally fell to Mehmet II in 1453  
- Greatest expansion in 1500s under Suleiman the Magnificent  

## Ottoman Imperial System  
Establishing a Centralized Bureaucracy  
- Traditional system of tribal alliances proved inadequate  
- Impose a clear-cut military structure to every aspect of government  

Sultan’s Civil Service—The Ghulam System  
- Devshirme—provincial slave levy dating to 1395 to supply “ghulams”
	- "Class of servant" might be more appropriate?
- Why Christian “slaves” instead of Muslim freemen?
	- Slave-Servant titling
	- Thought to be more selfless
	- Way to bypass traditional families and ranking systems. Far removed from their own customs. 
- Trained as administrators and soldiers—the Janissary Corps
	- Inner Service
		- Usually of gifted intellect, trained in languages, math, sciences, music.
		- Often became teachers, professors
		- Highest post of Grand Vizier appointed from the Janissary Corps  
	- Outer Service
		- Served outside of the court
		- Provisional Servants, but also Military Commanders, Ambassadors
	- Janissary ideal at its best
		- Loyalty to the Sultan
		- Participation in Spring(?) Corps
		- Self Denial, Discipline
		- Innovation, in strategy and technology.
- Janissaries’ new elite status  
	- Exempt from taxes
	- Evolved into the preeminent political and military elite in the Ottoman empire  
	- Over time, privileged status can also breed nepotism and corruption
		- By late 17th century, Janissary corps had grown from 7000 to 20,000 members  
		- Absentee officials buying titles of "Janissary", inflating numbers and reducing efficacy. Janissary becomes a lucrative trade.
			- Buyers of title did not even go through training, or have any outstanding mental skills. Janissary loses it's functional indication and becomes a symbol of monetary prestige.
		- By 19th century, as many as 100,000 people with title of "Janissary"
		- Loss of discipline in the rank and file of the corps  

Provincial Administration—The Timar System  
- Timars—administrative and tax-collecting grants dispensed by the Sultan  
- Organized according to military structure  
	- Direct correspondence between rank, revenue, and military responsibility  
	- All timariots(grant receivers) must dutifully collect taxes  
		- Third party oversight by qadis (judges) to assure fairness and accountability
- Inheritance of timar grants
	- The larger the grant, the larger the tax revenue that must be returned. Usually meaning only a third of the revenue stays locally.
	- Theoretically grant to be returned to the Sultan when a timariot dies
		- But, the longer a timar stays in a family, the more entrenched the timariot power becomes, to the point of being able to ignore Sultan orders
		- Eventually system also became susceptible to abuse 

Ethnic and Religious Communities—The Millet System  
- At first, religious or ethnic affiliation not a prerequisite for timar grants  
	- Local elites, Christian and Jewish, allowed to administer their own communities or millah (“nation” in Arabic)
	- Expectation is that no matter your origin, you will stay loyal to the Sultan because of this.
- Religious Tolerance  
	- Level of religious tolerance in stark contrast to that in European Christendom  
	- Overall, Ottoman rule was very accommodating to its dhimmi subjects
		- Ottoman empire becomes a haven for persecuted religious individuals
		- "Only in the Ottoman"
		- Over half of the Ottoman peoples were not Muslim
	- Yet, with decline, also came greater intolerance  
		- Division of (Askeri) ruling class and Reaya (ruled class) along religious lines  
		- By 18th century, greater discrimination against non-Muslim subjects  

Systemic Crisis Argument  
- End of expansion also meant exposing the structural fault-lines in the system  
	- Relied heavily on the military aristocracy:  
	- Central state kept them in check by provisional measures  
	- All short-term solutions that ironically contributed to long-term cancer

# Lecture 8 - The Safavid Empire
Key Focus:  
1) Impact of the Ottoman (Sunni)-Safavid (Shi’ite) split in Dar al-Islam  
2) Safavids’ use of religious extremism to inspire a following and forge an empire  
3) Transition from heterodox ideology to orthodox theocracy under Shah Abbas  

##  The Safavid Rise to Power in Persia  
Isma’il and the Messianic Ideology of the Qizilbash  
- In 1501, captured key city of Tabriz in northwestern Iran and founded a new dynasty  
- How did the 14-year-old Isma’il achieve this?  
	- Exploited every possible source of messianic ideology in Islam  
		- From the Shi’a tradition, beliefs of a sect known as the Twelvers  
			- Inclusion of divinity in his title as the “God-shah”  
			- Blasphemous claim
		- From the Sufi tradition, belief in transmission of mystical powers  
			- Qizilbash warriors claimed Isma’il as descendant of a 13th century Sufi leader—Safi al-Din  
	- Religious zealotry and divine purpose infused into the Safavid cause  
- Qizilbash fanaticism
	- Inspired terror due to their fanaticism and blood oath sworn to Isma’il
		- Participating in cannibalism to show loyalty to Isma'il
		- Even riding into battle unarmored.
	- Proved anathema to the Sunni conservatism of the Ottomans  

The Safavid-Ottoman Conflict  
- Clash of Heterodoxy vs. Orthodoxy  
	- Safavids intent on spreading their Sufi/Shi’ite ideology  
	- Ottomans equally intent on projecting themselves as defender of “true” Islam
	- Ottoman Sultan Selim the Grim's letter to Isma'li
	- Issued a fatwa on Isma'li's head
- Battle of Chaldiran (Kaldi-ran) 1514
	- Janissaries equipped with French weaponry (muskets, cannons) made a sound win for Ottoman empire
	- Safavids routed but not destroyed. Isma'li &/co move into Persian heartlands.
- Geopolitical consequences  
	- Ottoman-Safavid conflict lasted throughout the 16th to 18th centuries  
	- The interruption of the Mediterranean-Middle Eastern commercial network

# Lecture 9 - The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India
Main Focus:  
1) Muslim strategies for ruling the indigenous Hindu majority  
2) Akbar’s experiment with religious syncretism  

## The Initial Encounter  

Muslim nomads entered the Punjab in northern India as early as the 8th century  
- Plundered northern India for wealth but did not stay to govern  

Origin of the term “Hindu”?  
- Mutual Prejudice  
	- Hindu aloofness—regarded outsiders as inherently "impious and impure"
	- Muslim-Prejudice—Regarded Hindus as “incorrigible idol-worshippers”  
## The Delhi Sultanate (1205-1526)  
First Muslim rulers to establish a permanent foundation in northern India 
- *Choice to settle in order to better tap into lower resources*
- Reign of Alauddin Khalji (1296-1316)  
	- Policy of oppressing Hindu subjects through heavy taxation  
		- Tax them so much that “no Hindu could hold up his head”  
		- Exact tax payments using terror and harassment  
		- Relying on qadis (kazis) to sanction tax burden on Hindus  
	- Zia ud-din Barni: “the sultan had no acquaintance with learning...thus very few learned men visited him.”  
	- Sultan Alauddin’s approach more rule than exception

Ibn-Battuta ’s account of the Delhi Sultanate’s repressive policy  
- Born Abu Abdullah Muhammed Ibn-Battuta in Tangiers, Morocco (1304 C.E.)
- Trained as an Islamic Scholar and occasionally served as qadi
- Extent of his travels
	- Arrived in Delhi in 1333
	- Provided account of one sultan’s forced relocation of all Hindus from Delhi to Dawlat Abad because of a found missive insulting him
		- One legged man had difficulty leaving
			- Thrown from the tower "How dare you defy my order"
		- Blind man going in circles
			- Forced to be dragged behind a horse across land
			- Only the foot made it
Wealth amassed by the Delhi Sultanate
- Admiration for the minarets and mosques in Delhi  
- Awe at the wealth and generosity of the sultan
- But how was this wealth amassed?
	- Taxes, heavy heavy taxes. Wealth from the working class
- Bitter legacy of Muslim rule in India under the Delhi Sultanate tragically reverberates to this day.

Why Islam would remain a minority religion in India
- Animosity from minority Muslim rulers and majority Hindu subjects got worse with each ruler and each increased tax.
## Akbar’s Syncretic Experiment and Religious Pluralism
Height of the Mughal empire  
- Grandson of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire  
- Reigned from 1556-1605 
- Akbar’s Inclusive Method of Governing  
	- His own Grand Vizier was a Hindu named Birbal
		- Closest childhood friend and confidant
	- 1/3rd of bureaucracy was Hindu officials
	- Removed Jizya tax on Hindus

Promotion of the “Divine Faith” or Din-i-Ilahi  
- Merged the ethical foundations of Islam, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism  
- Reinforced emperor devotion as the embodiment of all these traditions  
- Similar to Shah Abbas in his theological curiosity  
- Frequently discussed theology with teachers of all faiths
	- E.g. painting depicting him conversing with Jesuit missionaries

Reversion to repression  
- Aurangzeb, his great grandson (1659-1707)  
- Failure of Mughals to win trust and loyalty of their Hindu subjects contributed to their subsequent decline
