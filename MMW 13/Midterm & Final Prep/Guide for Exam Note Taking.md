Your midterm exams in weeks four and seven will be designed primarily to assess how  
consistently and diligently you have been completing the assigned readings. As such, you should  
not have to spend long hours cramming for these assessments, as long as you complete each  
assigned reading following these guidelines:  
1) For each assigned reading item on the syllabus (each primary or secondary, excluding  
the WT/WA textbook), write down 1-3 main “take-aways” from the selection  
depending on its length and substance. For example, for Barfield’s “The Mongol  
Conquests,” my two main “take-aways” might be the following:  
a. The Mongols under Chinggis khan were conquerors by default rather than by  
design  
b. What “outer frontier strategy” meant for aggressive nomadic tribes tactically  
and why the Mongols could not capitalize on this  
2) For each main “take-away,” perhaps note 1-2 examples that illustrate that key point  
a. War of attrition with Jurchens in northern China and what victory threw in the  
lap of the Mongols  
b. Punitive expedition against the Khwarazm shah and the power vacuum that  
ensured  
c. Chinggis khan harassing and extorting concessions from the Tangut and  
Uighur kings, but could not count on the same from the Jurchens or Khitans  

3) Try to follow this exercise for each selection you read. Not only will this help you  
with the reading quizzes, but you will have these notes at your disposal when you  
prepare for the exams. The questions on the midterm will ask you to demonstrate that  
you have diligently and consistently completed your assigned readings to the point  
where you are able to understand the relevant connections and relationships between  
different readings.
