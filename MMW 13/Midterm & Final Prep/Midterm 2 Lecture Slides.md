## Lecture 10 - Europe’s Quest for Trade
Key Focus of Lecture:  
1) Motives behind the European push for exploration  
2) Why slow and incremental development of this process?  

## The Appetite for Spice  
Major Maritime Breakthroughs in late 15th century  
- 1488—Portuguese pilot Bartholomew Dias rounds the Cape of Good Hope  
- 1492 Columbus receives commission to sail across Atlantic  
- 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas  
- 1498 Vasco da Gama reaches Calicut, India after a grueling 10-month journey

What incentives had led to these breakthroughs?  
- Extend Christendom to outflank the spread of Islam  
	- Allure of the Prester John Myth
		- The "allure" of Prester John, a mythical Christian king, ==stemmed from a combination of factors==. His kingdom was described as a land of fabulous wealth and wonders, and he was portrayed as a powerful ally in the Crusades and against infidels (Indians), sparking European curiosity and desire for exploration. The legend also reflected a yearning for a virtuous, unifying monarch in a politically unstable Europe.
	- Vasco da Gama landed in Calicut hoping to find “Christians and spices”  
- Search for natural resources, esp. land to cultivate cash crops  
- Most importantly, trade incentives  
	- Alternative trade route to Asia, esp. more reliable access to spices  

The Demand for Pepper and other Spices  
- Conspicuous consumption and social class  
	- By 12th century, spices like ground pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon markers of wealth  
		- E.g. Ritual of displaying the “spice platter” during meals  
		- Spices given as coveted gifts like precious jewels  
	- In fact, spices became the ultimate “status symbols”  
		- The spicier the dish, the more respect the host garnered  
- Medieval Europe’s dependence on Asian imports  
	- Luxury items associated with “paradise,” with mythic Shangri-La  
	- Asian trade was the engine that drove the global economy  
- Rise of the nouveau-riche middle-class in late 14th century
	- By the late 1300s, price of ground pepper had risen 30-fold
	- Major 15th century crisis—search for new sea-route to satisfy pepper craving  

## Cape by Treacherous Cape  
Why did the “search” for a sea-route take so long?
- What’s so hard about sailing down W. Africa, hugging the coast all the way?  
- Sailing down was easy, but trying to sail back upwards, the winds would blow you outwards

John Thornton’s Analysis  
- “Short-range, unromantic, step-by step exploration was the principal method of European expansion”  
	- Lack of financial resources to fund ambitious transoceanic ventures  
- Slow, gradual understanding of patterns of prevailing winds and currents  
	- Westerlies vs. N.E. Trade winds  
	- But could Africans have sailed across the Atlantic to the Caribbean?  
- “Volta do Mar” or “return through the sea”
- Adoption of the maritime compass—a Chinese technology brought to Europe in 12th century by Arab merchants  

“African Wing” of Exploration 1340-1470  
- Step-by-step process, searching for opportunities to trade or raid  
- With every windfall, finance the next expedition  
- Island-hopping
	- Tacking all the way back north—“on a close reach”—they discovered  
		- 1300s Azores  
		- By 1350s, Madeiras, Canary Islands (“rediscovered” by Malocello)  
		- By 1400 Cape Verde Islands  
	- The Canary Islands—Colonial Blueprint for the Americas  
		- Indigenous Population—Guanche  
			- As of 1400, roughly 80,000 to 100,000 people in this group of islands 
			- Light-skinned people, perhaps related to Berbers of North Africa  
			- Neolithic hunter-gatherers, with little immunity to European diseases 
				- Pierre Chaunu’s idea of “disenclavement”  
				- Who did it benefit?  
		- By the 1400s, Castilian Spain had gained jurisdiction over the islands  
			- Ferdinand and Isabella solidified Castilian authority on the island  
			- Provided experience for subduing the Americas?

## Lecture 11 - The Portugese Intrusion
Key Questions:  
1) What geopolitical conditions allowed the Portuguese to become a key player in the Indian Ocean network?  
2) How did they maintain their tenuous hold in the 16th century? Why did they fail?  

## Contingent Global Factors Behind Portuguese Expansion  

Power vacuum in the Indian Ocean Network in 1498  
- No dominant power in the polycentric region  
- 1435 last Ming expedition  

Chinese vs. Portuguese “Networks”  
- Chinese fleets under Zheng He were not “empire-builders”  
- Unlike Portugal, an expansionist, proselytizing, and upstart power  

The Lure of Africa  
- The gold trade along the West African coastline  
- Raiding and trading provided revenue to bankroll further expeditions  
- Potential for pepper cultivation in sub-Saharan Africa

Ottoman Hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean  
- Attempt to circumvent the Ottoman blockade by going around Africa
- Safavid-Ottoman conflict also proved detrimental to integrity of trade routes

## Rogue Intervention at the “Crossroads of the World”—the Indian Ocean  

But Why Portugal?  
- Relatively poor state, with a largely agricultural and fishing economy  
- Could not muster more than 2 dozen warships in any region
- Pivotal role of Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460)
	- Provided a lot of funding for early expeditiomns
	- Helped contour and map out many of the islands

Vasco da Gama in 1498  
- First direct European contact with the Indian Ocean network—ominous beginnings  
- Created an atmosphere of mutual animosity and suspicion
	- Three months of intimidation and treachery, able to leave with cargo of nutmeg and pepper
	- Took emissary to hold hostage, in exchange -> Pilot to lead to the Indian trade route.

Portuguese Ambition of a Trade Monopoly in early 16th century  
- New generation of “colonial-soldier-administrators” like Don Francisco D’Almeida  
- Analyzed the structure of the trade network and aimed to monopolize it  
- By 16th century, controlled over 50 “chokepoints” or key transfer points of this network  
	- Kilwa—Southern terminus of Swahili-Indian Ocean link  
		- Intersection of faith and pillaging—seeking divine sanction?
		- Asked to pay 100 pounds of gold, instead sent goats and coconuts
			- Might have been some sort of symbolic gestures of welcome
	- Mombasa—key trade link between southern Africa and India  
		- Encountered more resistance, yet burned and pillaged  
		- Sultan of Mombasa’s letter to Malindi to describe the pillaging
			- Intended to warn Muslim ruler, drives wedge between former trading partners.
	- Port of Hormuz (1508)—narrow strait into Persian Gulf
	- Malacca (Malaka) (1511)  
	- Macao and Nagasaki
		- Don Afonse d’Alboquerque—main architect of this aggressive policy  
			- “Safe transit passes” for all entering and leaving “chokepoints” 
			- If no pass, your cargo will be confiscated, and hands of every sailor will be cut

Most significant was establishment of Estado do India (State of India) in 1510  
- Portugal’s second capital at the Indian city of Goa  
- Hallmarks of Portuguese Rule  
	- Religious Intolerance
	- Ruthless Intimidation  
		- Gaspar Correa’s account of da Gama’s brutality  
		- How best to explain this extreme behavior?  

## Demise of Portugal’s Quixotic Quest  

Acts of a desperate, aggressive, peripheral power chasing a grand ambition  
- “Chihuahua complex”  
- Shock was key reason why region was unprepared for the Portuguese  

Yet, Portugal could not sustain this hegemony for long  
- By end of 16th century, its hold in the Indian Ocean was tenuous at best  
	- Conflicting interests at home  
	- Private Portuguese contraband trade that circumvented the Crown  
- Resurgence of Islamic Power  
	- 1622 Safavids under Shah Abbas recaptured Hormuz  
	- 1698 Sultan of Oman captured the Swahili coastal cities

## Lecture 12 - Spanish Conquest of the Americas
## A Miraculous Conquest?  
Traditional Emphasis Regarding the Conquest  
- How could a few hundred conquistadors topple well-established empires?  
	- Fatalism of Moctezuma?  
		- The prophesy of the return of Quetzalcoatl—The Feathered Serpent 
		- Emphasis on pivotal role of Malinche (Dona Marina)?  
- Can we explain conquests simply through the acts and whims of a few individuals?
## Contingent Factors Behind the Spanish Conquest of the Aztecs  
Aztec Decline by early 1500s  
- Aztec empire had been sustained on a much-despised tributary system  
- Vicious cycle of decline  
	- As areas for expansion dwindled, bounty from conquests diminished  
	- More blood needed to revitalize the waning energy of the sun (Ritual explanation)
- Spaniards exploited the fractures within the crumbling Aztec system  

Spanish experience subjugating native populations  
- Canary Islands  
- For three decades, decimation of the Taino and Arawak people of the Caribbean  
	- 4 million in 1492 down to a few thousand in 1540s  

Advantages of Desperation (As a motivator for exploitation and riches)
- Like Portugal, Spain was on the fringe of Mediterranean commercial wealth  
- The conquistadors themselves usually were from the margins of Iberian nobility  
- Prior to 1519, only 1/3 of those who had crossed the Atlantic survived  

Hernan Cortes and the Capture of Tenochtitlan 1519  
- Moctezuma’s Ill-fated Hospitality 
	- Miscalculation: give them enough gold, so they might leave  
	- Just got greedier
- Similar to Pizarro’s tactics in the Inca capital of Cuzco  

## Aztec Resistance  
Sahagun’s Account of Aztec Perspective  
- Festival of Huitzilopochtli, the Sun-God
- Successful resistance led by Moctezuma’s successor, Cuauhtemoc

Siege of Tenochtitlan 1521  
- The return of Cortes with 13 sloops, blasting the wall with cannons
- Final defeat in 1521 after three-month siege after quetzal-owl was defeated

Demographic Catastrophe  
- No immunity to common Old World diseases, lot of death.

## Lecture 13 - Economic Exploitation of the Americas

Key Focus:
1)     Conflict between the missionary impulse and the economic incentive behind the Spanish colonial experience in the Americas
2)     Cultural and social repercussions of both goals

## Global Christendom or Silver Bullion?
Religious Conversion vs. Economic Exploitation
- Fundamental tension that defined 300 years of Spanish colonial rule in the Americas
- Missionary goals were to spread Christianity to potential natives, clashing with economic exploitation blueprint of Spain

Missionary Rationale for Conversion
- 1st Rationale: Native American peoples had “souls”
	- Valladodid Debate 1550—De Las Casas vs. Juan Sepuldeva
		- De Las Casas argued that the Native Americans had souls, countering Juan's claim for them being "Natural Slaves"
	- American “noble savages” vs. view of Africans per Aristotelian racist theories
	- Convenient racial stigma and double standard placed on Africans?
- 2nd Rationale: Duty to protect native Americans as subjects of the king
	- Idea of "Integration" into Spanish systems using "**reducciones**"—resettlement programs to gather scattered communities into controllable towns.

Champion of Missionary Cause: De Las Casas (1474-1566)
- Personal background
	- Inspired by moral arguments of Fray Antonio de Montesinos
	- Joined the Dominican Order after witnessing abuse in Carribeans
	- His 1542 Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies - Exposed Spanish brutality...
- Basis of what would become “The Black Legend”
	- De Las Casas’s graphic accounts of Spanish atrocities in the Caribbean
- Altruism or self-serving agenda behind the missionary rationale?
	- Missionaries often exaggerated native eagerness to embrace the gospel
		- Yet “The [_conquistadores_] have taken no more care to have the Faith of Jesus Christ preached to those nations than they would to have it preached to dogs or other beasts.”
		- Resulted often in half-hearted or perfunctory conversion
	- De Las Casas’s Appeal to the Spanish Crown, King Philip II - Was this Using Christianity to save souls or using converts to save the Catholic Church?

Conquistador Rationale for Economic Exploitation
- _Encomiendas_: “provisional trusteeships” given by the Crown to conquistadors
	- To assume essential administrative duties like labor and protection
	- _Encomenderos_ expected to safeguard the life and property of their native subjects but ended up abusing and extracting resources
- Missionaries appealed to the Crown to abolish encomiendas

The Crown’s compromise—a middle course
- Keep the encomiendas intact, but subject them to official regulation
	- Law of Burgos in 1512 - Set minimum standards for treatment of Indigenous laborers
	- System of Audiencias—royal judicial oversight over encomienda system, often corrupt though
	- New Law of 1542 as response to changing developments
		- Attempt to phase out encomiendas, but fiercely resisted by colonial elites.

## Silver and the Mercantilist Logic
Windfall of Silver
- Silver mines in Zacatecas (northern Mexico) and Potosi (modern-day Bolivia)
- American silver had “lubricated the world economy” (Bentley) - Fueling European wars and Asian commerce alike.
- Geopolitical advantages for Spanish Crown - Pretty much made them big dog, but also triggered inflation and dependency
- Mercantilist Assumptions - Spain hoarded bullion and limited foreign competition
	- Pursue protectionism as opposed to free trade

Spanish Implementation of Mercantilism
- Royal Monopoly over Silver production
	- Crown receiving 20% of all silver—the “Quinto”
	- In addition, monopoly over mercury - Ingredient in refining silver
		- Mercury mines in Huancavelica
- Monopoly over transport—The Flota System
	- Covered 85% of all Atlantic trade in 16th century
	- Safeguarded treasure fleets and restricted Colonial trade

Exploitation of conscript labor—Repartimiento
- Based on the old Inca Mita system of labor conscription
- Demographic consequences
	- Reviving Inca labor drafts (**mita**), Spain conscripted Native workers for mining and infrastructure, often under brutal conditions.
    - This led to catastrophic demographic collapse: millions of Indigenous people perished due to overwork and disease.

Missionaries’ Reaction
- Missionaries offered sanctuary in mission towns, shielding some Native communities from the worst abuses of the Repartmiento system
- However, their influence waned as the Crown cracked down on independent religious authorities, revoking mission charters.
- The repression extended culturally: Native religious art was destroyed, and **syncretism**—the blending of Indigenous and Christian beliefs—was harshly suppressed as heretical.

## Lecture 14 - Economies of Exploitation and The Atlantic Slave Trade
Key Focus:
1)     What were the economic driving forces behind the slave trade?
2)     What were some of its global repercussions?

## The Origin of the Atlantic Slave Trade
Slavery Prior to 1400
- In the 8th century, the word “slave” derived from ethnic reference “Slav”
- Key differences between pre-15th century and post-15th century slavery
	- First, ratio of slaves to free people in pre-15th century societies very low
	- Second, slave status hardly ever defined by a person’s race
- How did new type of slave enterprise arise?

The Sugar Connection
- A cultural consequence of the Crusades
- Developed Atlantic “sugar islands”
- By mid-1500s, Brazil would eclipse Atlantic islands as main supplier of sugar

The Economics of Plantation Societies
- Multinational enterprises
	- Required massive capital investment:
	- Transport of slaves and goods
- Introduced industrial-style mass production
	- Followed a capital-intensive vs. labor-intensive logic
		- Slaves treated as “factory machines” not “human workers” per se
		- More “economical” to replace than to sustain this labor resource
	- This logic most pervasive in South America and the Caribbean
		- Prohibition against slave households
	- For Europeans, important precursor for the Industrial Revolution?
		- Roots of proto-capitalism in slave-based plantations?
- Plantation economies also anticipated subversion against blatant exploitation
	- Resistance from slaves in places like Brazil, Jamaica, Dutch Surinam
	- Slave Revolt in Haiti 1792

## The Global Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade

The Triangular Trade of the Atlantic
- “Engine” that would propel Europe towards the Industrial Revolution?
- Created “great wealth for few, great misery for many”

“Refinement of Cruelty”
- Olaudah Equiano’s chronicles
- Descriptions of the loading of slaves and “The Middle Passage”
	- Thomas Phillips in 1694—captain of the Hannibal
		- Africans “as much as the works of God’s hands”
		- Yet, fully embraced a paternalistic, colonial rationale

Estimate of Numbers
- From 1500 to 1870, roughly 12 million African slaves made it alive to the Americas
- Africa’s population attrition should easily exceed 25 million

Long-term Impact of the Slave Trade on Africa
- Geopolitical Power Shifts
	- General destabilization and depopulation of the region
		- King Afonso’s plea to Portuguese Crown 1526
	- Power shifts from inland Sub-Saharan kingdoms to tropical coast states
		- Brutal, aggressive native regimes driven by greed to meet demand for slaves
- Effect on Economic Productivity
	- Depletion of young men of reproductive age in West Africa
	- Productive human resources exchanged for non-productive luxury items
	- Lasting impact on Africa’s inability to catch up to the industrial world?
- Explanations for the Rise of the West

## Lecture 15 - The Black Death

Key Questions:
1)     How did the Christian and Islamic worlds respond differently to the onslaught of the Black Death?
2)     What lasting social, economic, and cultural repercussions did the Black Death have on late medieval Europe?

## The Magnitude of the Black Death
Ripe Preconditions
- Demographic changes
	- Warming trend from 800 to 1200—population density
	- The Great Famine 1315-1322 in northern Europe
- From local epidemics to global pandemic
	- Greater proximity between human settlements and wilderness
		- In 1300s, transmitted by fleas first to rats, then to humans
	- Interlocking trade networks—yet another side-effect of globalization

How the Plague Spread in Europe 1347-1350
- Invariably followed the contours of the trade routes
- Death toll of the Plague
## Responses to the Plague
In Europe
- Boccaccio’s Decameron
	- Preemptive measures
	- Plenty of warning, but utter sense of futility
- Range of psychological responses
	- Ascetic approach vs. hedonistic approach
	- Most practiced moderate forms of protection
	- Boccaccio: “general lack of regard citizens and relations showed to each other”
	- Desperate flight from cities
- Ideas of original sin and innate depravity
	- Plague understood as God’s punishment
		- Flagellants and scapegoating
	- Apocalyptic Vision
		 - General escalation of hysteria, persecution, and violence

In Islamic Regions—esp. Sunni Mamluk territory
- Emphasis on maintenance of community
- Plague as a “collective social calamity”—encouraged focus on community
	- Continuation of all civic and religious activities
- Overall, Muslim response was one of “reverent resignation”
	- More “pacific, collective, and controlled”
	- Orthodox Muslims did not entertain a vision of the apocalypse
- Detractors like Ibn-al Khatib in Granada

## The Plague as “Watershed in Medieval History”
“Reverent resignation” vs. Individual agency
- Community vs. each for oneself
- Status quo vs. whatever radical means possible
 - In Europe, more desperate and audacious attempt to change one’s own destiny

Social Impact of Depopulation
- Bargaining Power of Peasantry
	- Peasants’ lot improved vis-à-vis nobility
	- Shift to skilled labor jobs in cities that paid more

Economic Impact of New Trend in Consumption
- Higher demand for manufactured goods and luxury imports after the Plague
	- Harry Miskimin’s “The Economy of Early Renaissance Europe 1300-1460”
		- Increase in purchasing power of survivors
		- Additional resources for consumption and investment
- Spurred higher demand for manufactured luxury goods
	- Royal ordinances to relax restrictions for entering guilds
	- Shortage of skilled labor also led to higher wages

Implications of Demographic Changes for Europe’s Renaissance
- Economic boost to the manufacturing sector and commerce in luxury items
- Extra capital for patrons of culture and investors in exploration and industry
- Rebirth of Europe “forged in the crucible of its terrible yet transcendent ordeal with the Black Death”

Jonathan Kennedy’s _Pathogenesis_ (2023)
- “It’s a bacterial world and we’re just squatting here”

## Lecture 16 - Hysteria and Ethnic Scapegoating in Spain
Key Questions:
1)     What impact did the Black Death have on the legacy of anti-Semitism in Europe?
2)     How did anti-Semitism intensify in Spain between the 14th and 17th centuries?

## Anti-Semitism and the Black Plague
Outbreak of Pogroms—organized mob attacks on Jews
-  Coincided with the plague’s arrival in southern France and Spain in 1348
- Christian mobs invading the “Aljamas” or Jewish enclaves

Royal Response in Spain
- King Pedro IV condemned these anti-Semitic pogroms as “diabolical”
- Why was this a symbolic rebuke at best?
- To what extent was the violence culturally sanctioned?  To what extent did the authorities turn a blind eye?

## The Black Death as “Watershed” in European Anti-Semitism

Turning Point for Jewish-Christian Relations?
- Simply isolated, brief episodes of persecution—no “paradigm shift”?
- Or did anti-Semitism gain a “normative” foundation in Europe?

Anti-Semitism in Pre-modern Europe
- The Effect of the Crusades starting in 1096
- Why Pick on the Jews?
	- Growing wealth and clout of some Jews in the financial sector
	- By 12th century, sanctioned harassment and extortion commonplace
		- E.g. Ritual of striking a Jew on Easter Sunday in front of a church
- Many royals and nobles competed for jurisdiction over Jewish subjects
	- Nurtured a “patronage” relationship between Jews and Crown
	- As “wards” of the king, Jews very vulnerable to persecution and expulsion
		- First major expulsion was in 1184 in Bavaria
- Convenient and _conspicuous_ target
	- Overall, subject to “the whims of the rulers, prejudices of the populace, and the objections of the clergy” (Boase 3)
	-  For Jews in Spain, persecution culminated in their expulsion in 1492

## The Persecution of Moors in Spain
Domestic “Crusade” against Islam
- By 1499, men like Cardinal Cisneros ordering mass conversions and burning of books in Arabic, including treasured copies of the Qur’an
- King Phillip II again banned use of Arabic in public and Moorish customs in 1567
	 - Insurrections of the Alpujarras in 1499 and 1568
- By the early 1500s, waves of forced conversions
	- Many “conversos” had no choice but to live a double life
	- Issuing of the Taqiyyah

Catch-22 for “_conversos_”
- As “new Christians,” now subject to the Inquisition
	- Victims of “el agradable holocausto”—“agreeable holocaust” of burnt offering
- From “Moro” to “Morisco” or “little Moor”
	- Target of “slanderous anecdotes, insulting remarks, distortions,” such as propensity for pride, avarice, promiscuity, cunning, etc. (Boase 5)

Expulsion 1609-1614
- Estimate of Moors in Spain in early 17th century—600,000
- Arguments made by the likes of Archbishop Juan de Ribera
	-  Moors licentious by nature, highly susceptible to “sins of the flesh”
	- Smear campaign led to the eviction of Moors from many cities
	- Muslim refugees and asylum seekers seldom given warm welcome anywhere
- Overall, as many as 2/3rd of Spanish Moors perished as a result of the expulsion
## Lecture 17 - The Rise of Anti-Semitic Persecution in Germany
- Main Thesis: The extent to which a community allows seeds of discrimination and prejudice to fester in times of relative stability and peace will generally predetermine how violently it responds when crisis erupts

## The Mechanism of Persecution
The “Innocuous” Seeds of Prejudice
- A culture of persecution often may seem relatively mild, trivial, and harmless
- But when crisis occurs, persecution can reach horrific proportions

Need to understand persecution “historically”?
- How it can be reinforced by stereotypes, jokes, rumors, customs, etc.
- Key is to examine the social mechanism behind persecution

## The Trial of Endingen in 1470
The setting—three Jewish brothers accused of ritual murder and executed
- Emperor Frederick III’s stern letter of rebuke in the aftermath
	- Should not have tried and executed Jews without imperial sanction
	- Ultimately, more out of concern for Habsburg authority than justice for Jews

Political Implications in the 15th century Breisgau Valley
- German townships and Swiss cantons in the Vorderostericch (Further Austria) 
	- Actively contested Habsburg jurisdiction over local political and legal matters
	- Tolerance for Jews reminded them of their subservience to Habsburg authority
	- Jews became pawns in contest between Habsburg rule and German defiance

Circumstances Behind the Accusation
- Discovery in 1470 in a collapsed charnel house
- How could they have jumped to such unfounded conclusion?
	- Jews as enemies of Christ
		- Worshipped in the “Synagogue of Satan”—cult rituals and orgies
		- “Ritual murder” myth
	- Stigma of Victimhood

Guilty Verdict from the Outset
- Brothers not innocent until proven guilty, but guilty by virtue of being a Jew
- Confessions extracted from torture
	- Mercklin’s “confession” as to “Why was Christian blood needed?”
	- Likely threatened with common torture called strappada
- Why circumcision accepted as motive?

Fabrication of a Conspiracy 
- Building the case for a Jewish “conspiracy”
	- Significance: Blame it on a cultural, religious practice ubiquitous to all Jews
- Treat murder as religious evil of Judaism, not as secular crime
- So that Endingen can finally be “Juden Frei” or “Jew Free”

The “Spill-over Effect” of Endingen
- Set legal precedent for other cases of anti-Semitic persecution
- Last but not least, “story becoming history”
