### 1 - What “outer frontier strategy” meant for aggressive nomadic tribes tactically and why the Mongols could not capitalize on this  
- Outer Frontier Strategy - Yoink Agricultural and "Settler Type Materials"
	- Nomads in China typically don't want to "conquer" because they don't want to stay. Rather prefer to use tactical superiority and "Yoink and dip strategy" to retreat back to steppe
	- They also usually target smaller, more subservient settlements. Jurchen was not small, nor subservient. Held out (Moving of capital to create defensive, large walls and high troop numbers)
- Chinggis Khan's use of this largely ineffective against the growing settling "empires" of Chin Dynasty, Mongols had to wage war to get anything. 
	- Resulted in heavy losses in people, materials, etc. Pyrrhic Victory and low return on investment. 
	- Same application to Tangut state
### 2 - The Mongols under Chinggis khan were conquerors by circumstance rather than by design
- After high losses, melding of ideas of "Return to the Steppe, wreak havoc on the useless people" and "Hold this big empire, become tax collectors" did not mix well.
	- Policy on taxes sucked, and less people to tax due to mass migration and deaths as seen by census drop from 50 mil to +/-8 mil
- Mismanagement and lack of understanding on where resources came from meant bad policies left and right
	- Ogodei's idea to "revert the farmland to pasture" contered because who tf is gonna make the resources to extract if the land and farmers are killed.
