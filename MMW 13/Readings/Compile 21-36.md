## The Birth of an Atlantic World
=======
## 21
origin/main
Description: A retrospective wide lens analysis on the European efforts to conquer the sea and trade routes to Africa
Type: Secondary
- Argues the primary motivation was spice, that Europe was largely unsuccessful in strongmanning the African coast, and had to concede to trade relations. Also argued that Iberia wasn't the only country that put effort into exploration.
### 1 - The Europeans were really sweating to try and expand
- "Thus, the actual motivation for European expansion and for navigational breakthroughs was little more than to exploit the opportunity for immediate profits made by raiding and the seizure of purchase of trade commodities."
- "Europeans clearly hoped that their maritime abilities would give them military advantages that would result in large profits and perhaps conquests. They were prepared to take over territory and enslave people, and their actions in the Canary islands bore witness to that desire."
	- "The inhabitants (of the Senegal Islands)... had little other recourse than to try and flee to areas of difficult access
- "(Africans couldn't fight Europeans at sea, Europeans couldn't effectively use naval on land). As a result, the Europeans had to abandon... trading and raiding and substitute a relationship based more or less completely on peaceful regulated trade"
### 2 - The unlocking of new nautical technologies helped finally traverse the previously impenetrable and slow channels,
- "In many ways, in the days of wooden sailing ships, the ocean was as much channeled as were rivers whose direction of flow was clearly defined. This was crucian for the development of Atlantic navigation, for the winds and currents created barriers to traffic for thousands of years."
<<<<<<< HEAD
- "(In response to commercial possibilities) the prospects of the next stretch of coast to produce the pepper known as Malaguetta pepper were known to Fernao Gomes, when he petitioned the Crown for exclusive rights to the trade of West Africa... In any case, his grant included a provision that he explore further sections of the coast, and his expeditions rapidly began exporting the pepper"

## Kilwa, Mombasa, and the Portugese
Description: An account of the Portugese's Intrusion of the Spanish held continents of Kilwa and Mombasa 
Type: Primary
### 1 - The Portugese were received with relative kindness and respect.
- "He excused himself from coming, but sent the Grand-Captain gifts instead; They were five goats, a small cow and a large number of coconuts and other fruit,"
	- I mean come on, showing up one day and demanding audience is crazy work. In a way Kilwa's actions can be disrespectful, but not murder disrespectful. You don't just do that without a motive.
- "There came out a Spanish Christian who was living there...He told the Christians to go away.... but that if they were keen to come ashore the people were ready to set about them for their supper. "
	- Mombasa knew what the Portugese were going to do, so they already start fighting. Even so, they still offered to truce and set them with supper
### 2 - The Portugese really were more concerned with plundering the cities
- "This flag had been left by the admiral [Vasco de Gama] when he had arranged for Kilwa to pay a tribute of 1500 ounces of gold a year."
	- The key thing to remember here is that they were doing this via force - Kilwa owed the Portugese nothing but were forced to be under a tyrant.
- "The Grand-Captain ordered that the town should be sacked and that each man should carry of to his ship whatever he found: so that at the end there would be a division of spoil, each man to receive a twentieth of what he found."
	- The fact that these people also just motivated themselves on the fact that they could plunder for their own gain is CRAAAZY WORK.

## The Portugese in Africa and India
Description: Collection of Primary Selections of Duarte Barbosa, an agent of the Portugese government who helped establish commercial contacts along the east African coast, as he describes the people and products of the area.
Type: Primary
### 1 - The Portugese see themselves as the hero here
- "On Kilwa) This town was taken by force from its king by the Portugese, as, moved by arrogance, he refused to obey the King our Lord."
- "(On Sofala) These Moors have dwelt there a long time by reason of the great traffic which they carried on with the heathen of the mainland"
- "(On Mombasa) The king of this city refused to obey the commands of the King our Lord and through this arrogance he lost it, and our Portugese took it from him by force."
- "(On The City of Brava) It has no kings, but is ruled by elders, and ancients of the land, who are the persons held in the highest esteem... And this place was destroyed by the Portugese, who slew many of its people and carried many into captivity, and took great spoil of gold and silver and goods."

## Cut off their ears, hands and noses
Description: Excerpts from Gaspar Correa, who sailed with Vasco de Gama, detailing an incident after a group of Portugese were killed in a trading station of Calcutta
Type: Primary
### 1 - The Portugese were a vengeous kind, even thought hey were the ones who are encroaching.
- "He then ordered all the fleet to draw in close to the shore, and all day, till night, he bombarde the city, by which he made a great destruction"
- "Then the captain-major commanded them to cut off the hands and ears and noses of all the crews, and put all that into one of the small vessels..."
	- He then goes on to tie them all up, lug them into a boat, and have the boat set on fire.
	- The vessel with ears, with the friar, is sent to the shore. 
	- Note that this is a fear tactic, to be taken as a sign of what happens when you mess with the Portugese trade.

## The Battle for Tenochtitlan - An Aztec Perspective

Description: Bernardino de Sahagun was a member of the Franciscan Order and an early Spanish missionary in Mexico. He learned the language the Aztecs used and wanted to preserve the memory of their culture — this was opposed by fellow Spanairds who thought this got in the way of Christianization
Type: Primary
### 1 - The Spanish were greedy mfers
- "Like monkeys they grabbed the gold.... For gold was what they greatly thirsted for; they were gluttonous for it, starved for it, piggishly wanting it."
- Example 2
### 2 - The Spanish were brutal asf, directly and indirectly
- "They struck a drummers arms; both of his hands were severed. Then they struck his neck; his head landed far away. Then they stabbed everyone with iron lances and struck them with iron swords. They struck some in the belly, and then their entrails came spilling out. They split open the heads of some, they really cut their skulls to pieces.... Those who tried to escape could go nowhere. When anyone tried to go out, at the entryway they struck and stabbed him."
- "(On Diseases) First an epidemic broke out, a sickness of pustules... Large bumps spread on people, some were entirely covered... The disease brought great desolation; a great many died of it."
- "(On the wall blocking to Xoloco) They fired the big guns at it. At the first shot it did not give way, but the second time it began to crumble. The third time, at last parts of it fell to the ground, and the fourth time finally the wall went to the ground once and for all"

## 3 - The Mexican-Spanish Technology and warfare disparity was massive
- "They came out and chased the Spaniards in the passageway, and when the Spaniards saw it they, the Mexica, seemed to be Intoxicated"
	- Man, the Mexicans were drunk, still a more primitive way of fighting.
- "And when the sacrifice was over, they strung the Spaniards heads on poles on skill racks."
- "and in early august the Aztecs decided to send into battle a quetzal-owl warrior, whose success or failure, it was believed, would reveal if the gods wished the Aztecs to continue the war"
	- Like seriously these guys were out of food, water, they were drunk, stuck on rituals, this was brutal.
- "Let him wear it, let him die in it. Let him dazzle people with it, let him show them something; let our enemies see and admire it... And the reason they did this was that was as though the fate of the rulers of the Mexica were being determined"

## 26 - Land and Labor in Spanish America

Description: A series of primary sources illustrating the political workings of the encomienda "Free Labor"
Type: Secondary 
- The Encomienda system was a system of forced labor that tried to act like it was an attempt to "Civlilize" the people. This was a purely economic goal for them.
### 1 - "The Encomenderos just kept asking man"
- "...and the Indians give every day two chickens and four loads of wood."
- "Also they are to make the plantings of peppers, beans, maize, and wheat as stated"
- "(in 1558) from now on for a period of eight years the natives of the said town are to give in tribute to the said encomenderos each year 286 common gold pesos paid three times a year."
	- "(Then, in 1565) ordered that the natives give in tribute each year 964 gold pesos and seven tomines of common gold, the payments are to be made three times a year.
	- Obligations kept changing
- "And they are not to be taxed or assessed or required to pay more tribute...."(1558)
	- Repeated in some form every other encomienda, suggesting the Indians kept pushing back.
### 2 - All the legislation to prevent encomendero abuse, especially to indians was hella ignored
- "...because they said they did not want to give them since the macehuelas would not serve as carriers, he took them by their hair and gave them many kicks, calling them dogs and sons of whores"
	- An account of a court proceeding complaining against Juan Ponce, showed that these guys did not care at all.
- "... their master increased the amount they were obligated to give by half, and they have given him this for eight years without being paid for it."
- "Also, the last sunday, the said Juan Ponce ordered the macebuelas to bring they wheat they are obligated to give, and because they did this they did not hear Mass"
	- Shows how they couldn't hide behind religious tones here, and also an appeal to their Christian sympathizers. o
### 3 - Main Point 3
- Example 1
- Example 2

### 1) **"Land and Labor in Spanish America" (_The Human Record_)**

**Connections to Lecture Outline:**

- **Encomienda System as Exploitative Labor Control**
    
    - Both the source and the outline highlight the encomienda as a system that claimed to protect and Christianize Natives but in reality functioned to extract labor and resources, directly connecting to the outline's section on **Conquistador Rationale for Economic Exploitation**.
        
- **Crown's Legal Reforms and Ineffectiveness**
    
    - The reading discusses royal laws (like the Laws of Burgos and New Laws) intended to regulate labor abuses—paralleling the lecture’s point about **The Crown’s Compromise** through regulation that often failed in practice.
        
- **Repartimiento and Demographic Collapse**
    
    - The exploitation through systems like the **repartimiento** and its impact on Native populations is emphasized in both the text and your lecture’s **Silver and the Mercantilist Logic** section.

##  Persecutor Turns Protector
Description: An account of a Spanish encomendero turned Catholic essentially ratting out the immorality and depravity that the Indies were being treated with
Type: Primary or Secondary?
- Scholarly Argument present?
### 1 - The Indies were perfectly willing to be Christianized, and they were good people
- "And of all the infinite universe of humanity, these people are the most guileless, the most devoid of wickedness and duplicity, the most obedient and faithful to their native masters and to the Spanish christians whom the my serve" (In describing the population of the Indies that they encountered) 
- "...docile and open to doctrine, very apt to receive our holy Catholic faith... And once they begin to hear the tidings of the Faith, they are so insistent on knowing more and on taking the sacraments of the Church and on observing the divine cult that, truly, the missionaries who are here need to be endowed by God with great patience in order to cope with such eagerness." (on the contrary to the slave tending nature the Indies were described by) 
### 2 - - The Spanish did not respect god nor the king
- "...nothing was done to incline the Indians to embrace the one true Faith, they were rounded up and in large numbers forced to do so... They are told they must embrace the Christian faith immediately; without hearing any sermon preached and without any indoctrination
- "And those who, in the Indies, had charge of the ruin and the robberies have continued, as if no orders had been issued... to engage in still more disorders before the new judges had should arrive to execute the laws" (After the laws of 1542)
### 3 - The encomenderos would do anything deplorable to get their money.
- "A cacique... had given the tyrant...gold worth nine thousand castellanos. Not content with this amount, the Governor had the cacique bound to a stake... and set fire to the soles of his feet, demanding more gold" (This continues until the cacique passes from their wounds.)
### 2) **De Las Casas, "Persecutor turns Protector"**

**Connections to Lecture Outline:**

- **Personal Transformation from Encomendero to Reformer**
    
    - The reading narrates De Las Casas’s shift after witnessing Native suffering, directly matching the lecture's section on **De Las Casas’s Personal Background** and moral awakening.
        
- **Condemnation of Conquistadores’ Indifference to Conversion**
    
    - De Las Casas’s critique that the Spanish cared as little for preaching to Natives as to "dogs or other beasts" mirrors the lecture’s quotation and criticism of **perfunctory conversion**.
        
- **Appeal to Spanish Crown for Reform**
    
    - His direct petitions to the monarchy, including influence on the **New Laws of 1542**, align with your outline’s mention of his **Appeal to King Philip II** and efforts to reform Spanish colonial policy.'

## The Black Legend
Description: De Las Casas' accounts of violence, used to reinforce the Spanish "Black Legend"
Type: Primary
### 1 - The Black Legend was that the Spanish were terrorists
- "They started taking for themselves the food that natives contrived to produce by the sweat of their brows."
- "The Christians punched them, boxed their ears and flogged them in order to track down the local leaders; and the whole shameful process came to a head when one of the European commanders raped the wife of the paramount chief of the entire island"
- "They hacked them into pieces, slicing open their bellies with their swords as though they were so many sheep herded into a pen. They even laid wagers on whether they macould nanage to slice a man in two at a stroke, or to cut an individuals head from his body, or disembowel him with a single blow of their axes. "

## A Journal of a Voyage Made in the Hannibal of London in 1694

Description: A Primary Account of the Slave Trade 
Type: Primary
### 1 - Gang they were doing trade offers on black people
- "Capt Clay and I had agreed to go to the trunk to buy the slaves by turns, each his day, so that we might have no distraction or disagreement in our trade."
	- Wow, transaction of slaves, how businesslike, how demure.
- "And our surgeon examined them well in all kinds, to see that they were sound wind and limb, making them jump, stretch out their arms swiftly, looking in their mouths to judge of their age"
## 2 - Just some points
- Phillips makes passing moral reflections but does not question the legitimacy of slavery itself.
- He repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of discipline — including whipping and chaining — to maintain order on board.
- His narrative offers a stark portrait of how slavery was normalized as commerce, not atrocity.
- “I cannot pretend to justify the slave trade... but it is necessary for the colonies.”
- “They die like flies, and yet the profits stand.”
- “The smell below decks was enough to choke a man — yet we held our noses and did our duty.”

## Our Kingdom is Being Lost

Description: King Alfonso II's troubles with European dickishness as related to the Spanish Slave Trade
Type: Primary
### 1 - The Spanish trade is toxic asf
- "...since this is caused by the excessive freedom given by your agents and officials to the men and merchants who are allowed to come tot this kingdom to set up shops with goods and many things which have been prohibited by us. "
- "And to avoid it we need from your kingdoms no more than some priests and a few people to teach in schools, and no other goods except wine and flour for the holy sacrament"
### 2 - The Slave trade just keeps taking our people
- "Your people,... seize many of our people, free and exempt ment, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and the sons of noblemen, and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our Kingdoms."

## The Life of Olando Equiano
Description: Primary account of how slaves were being treated and dehumanized.
Type: Primary
## 1 - Yeah these people were not treated well
- "Here they tied our hands and continued to carry us as far as they could till night came on."
- "if ten thousand wordds had been my own, I would have freely parted with them all to have exchanged my condition with that of the meanest slave with my own country"
- "Is it not enough that we are torn from our country and friends to toil for your luxury and lust of gain?"

## Selections from the Black Death
Description: What is it?
Type: Secondary?
- Scholarly Argument present?
### 1 - The Black Death was Cray Cray
- "The establishment of the far-flung Mongol Empire by the second half of the thirteenth century linked Asia to Europe in an overland network of mounted armies, postal carriers, and caravans. Once transmitted from its endemic carriers in the East, the plague easily made its way across Europe through well-established trade links.
- "New research suggest that the estimate must be revised upwards to an average mortality rate of at least 50 percent"
- "Labor shortages impelled the use of more efficient agricultural techniques and the introduction of manufacture such as the printing press"
### 2 - The Different Reaction to the Plague
- (Christian) Gabriele de Mussis tried to describe it as divine retribution
	- "...looked down from on high upon the entire human race and saw it sliding into all kinds of wickedness, embracing out of sheer persistence numberless crimes and transgressions..."
	- "And after mortals had thus been warned the quivering spear of the Almighty, in the form of the plague, was sent down to infect the whole human race, aiming its cruel darts everywhere"
- (Muslim and Christian) Imad Al-din Abu L-fida Isma'il b Umar Ibn Kathir thought it was a struggle to overcome with faith
	- "On the morning of June 7, the crowd re assembled before the mihrab of the Companions of the Prophet, and it resumed the recitation of the flood of Noah, of which a reading was made 3363 times."
	- Christians were there
- (Muslim) Ibn al-Wardi thinks it was a sign of reinforcement of their own faith
	- "This plague is for the Muslims a martyrdom and a reward, and for the disbelievers a punishment and a rebuke"
	- "It has been established by our Prophet... that the plague-stricken are martyrs. This noble tradition is true and assures martyrdom"
	- "Come then, seek the aid of God Almighty for raising the plague, for He is the best helper"
- () Lisan Al-din Ibn Al-Khatir rejects the Predominant hadith explanation
	- "And it is not a secret to whoever has looked into this matter... that those who come into contact with plague patients mostly die, while those who do not come into contact survive."
	- "And the safety of those who have gone into isolation is demonstrated by the example of the ascetic, Ibn Abu Madyan."
	- "And amidst the horrible afflictions that the plague has imposed upon the people, God has afflicted the people with some learned religious scholars who issue fatwas against fleeing the plague, so that the quills with which the scholars wrote these fatwas were like swords upon which the muslims died"

● City Magistrates (Italian Ordinances)
○ Tried to enforce quarantine, crowd control, and sanitation.
○ Showed early efforts at public health amid limited knowledge.
● Clergy and Monks
○ Died in large numbers, leaving communities spiritually adrift.
○ Often believed the plague was divine punishment.
● Flagellants
○ Paraded through towns self-harming to atone for society’s sins.
○ Represented religious hysteria and collective desperation.

## A Most Terrible Plague

Description: A collection of stories during the Renaissance between friends, most notably Giovanni Boccaccio, revered humanist. Part of a larger work, The Decameron
Type: Primary Source 
- Scholarly Argument present?
### 1 - The Plague completely overwhelmed the people of Florence
- "In spite of all the means that art and human foresight could suggest, such as keeping the city clear from filth, the exclusion of all suspected persons, and the publication of copious instructions for the preservation of health... it began to show itself in the spring of the aforesaid year (1348)"
	- Remembering that the relative "best" practices the people of this time knew, from decades of study and experience, could not make a dent on the start and spread of the plague would have been terrifying. 
- "To the cure of this malady., neither medicinal knowledge nor the power of drugs was of any effect; whether because the disease was in its own nature mortal, or that the physicians... could form no just idea of the cause, nor consequently devise a true method of cure"
	- Despite the advancements in Science and the Medicines, the true nature of the Black Death was a challenge way over the ability of the people of the time to conquer.  
- "Whichever was the reason, few escaped; but nearly all died the third day from the first appearance of the symptoms, some sooner, some later, without any fever or accessory symptoms"
	- Black death aura farming. Joking aside, the terrifying experience of the unique symptoms leaning to death, the ability for it to transmit almost invisibly, and its relative ease of spreading meant if you were in Florence, you were fucked.
### 2 - People were came to the same conclusion - avoid the sick and isolate yourself
- "All tending to the same uncharitable and cruel end; which was, to avoid the sick, and every thing that had been near them."
	- Analysis and connection to theme
- "And some... to avoid excess of all kinds, made parties, and shut themselves up from the rest of the world; eating and drinking moderately of the best, and diverting themselves with music"
	- Analysis and connection to theme
- "Others maintained free living to be a better preservative, and would baulk no passion or appetite they wished to gratify, drinking and reveling incessantly.... yet strenuously avoiding, with all this brutal indulgence, to come near the infected."
	- Analyss
- "A third sort of people chose a method between these two.... eating and drinking what their appetites required, they walked everywhere with [fragrances and nose-coverings]"
### 3 - People started to prioritize themselves and the present. Full survival instincts
- "For their terror was such, that a brother even fled from his brother, a wife from her husband, and, what is more uncommon, a parent from their own child."
	- Nobody knew how to survive other than to avoid the plague, and the fact that people had to leave each other to survive should be horrifying. 
- "You might see the poor distressed labourers... without either the aid of physicians, or help of servants, languishing on the highways, in the fields, and in their own houses, and dying rather like cattle than human creatures. The consequence was that.... supposing every day to be their last, their thoughts were not so much employed how to improve, as how to use their substance for their present support"
	- If you were a peasant, gg, throw yo stuff and go next at that point. 

## Jewish pogroms

Description: Retrospective compilation and analysis of the accounts of Jewish Pogroms as they affected the Jewish community; A retrospective analysis on the accusations against the Jews implicating them in the spread of the plague. 
Type: Secondary due to its added dialogue, containing Primary Sources
- Argues that the reasons for actually persecuting the Jews were more personal and vindictive towards a class if anything.

### 1 - Money was a main motive here
- "This created a tense dynamic between city rulers, anxuous to preserve Jews as potential sources of tax revenue, and the pipulace, equally anxious to be rid of the debts they owed them."
- "Like hypocritical robbers, they carried off all their goods and possessions, and they tore up and also burned many debt instrument sand records that had been contracted with various Jews"
### 2 - The Jews were also scapegoats for anything and everything
- ""Even thought these alleged offenses seem to have been treated as secular crimes, the preferred method of execution - burning at the stake, suggests the antiheretical procedures of the Inquisition.
- "Pope Clement left open the door for further persecutions, provided they were legal"

## THe Muslim Expulsion from Spain
- (First rebellion and asssasination of the cardinals agent) "This in turn gave the Catholic monarchs an excuse to revoke their promises"
- "(On the moor, now morisco). every aspect of his way of life - including his language, dress and social customs, was condemned as uncivilized an pagan"
- "But purity of faith came to be identified with purity of blood so that alle New Christians... were rbanded as potential heretics"
  "The demographic factor was one of the most decisive argumens...by Juan de Ribera. He warned that unless he took swift action, christian Spaniards would soon find themselves outnumbered by Muslims"
	- "The Moriscos....thjink only of reproducing and saving their skins, while their temperance in food and drink gives them a high life expectancy"
- "It was this refusal to renounce their religious and cultural identity that many Old Christian found offensive"'

Source Type: Secondary
● Empire & Timeframe: Iberian Peninsula, 1492–1609 CE (Reconquista and aftermath)
● Comparison: Parallels Jewish Pogroms as another example of religious persecution in crisis;
contrasts with Ottoman Intercommunal Relations, which protected minority faiths.
● Moriscos (Converted Muslims)
○ Lived in suspicion, forced to perform Christianity under threat.
○ Were expelled despite generations of cultural assimilation.
● Spanish Inquisitors
○ Monitored religious “purity” through fear and surveillance.
○ Criminalized identity and enacted systemic persecution.
● Catholic Monarchs (Ferdinand and Isabella)
○ Initiated policies to “purify” Spain and consolidate power.
○ Framed religious unity as national destiny.

● Boase outlines the policies leading to the forced conversion, expulsion, and eventual diaspora
of Muslims from Spain.
● After the Christian conquest of Granada in 1492, initial promises of tolerance were quickly
revoked.

● Muslims (and later Moriscos) were pressured to convert, and even converts were treated with
suspicion and contempt.
● The Spanish Inquisition enforced religious conformity through torture, surveillance, and exile.
● The reading emphasizes the loss of cultural hybridity — once a site of coexistence, Spain
became ideologically monolithic.
● It explores how the expulsion damaged not only Muslim communities but also Spanish
economic and intellectual life.
● In 1609, over 300,000 Moriscos were expelled, many of whom had never lived outside Spain.
● Granada’s Alhambra, once a symbol of Muslim splendor, became a Christian royal palace.
● “They were Christians in name, but Muslims in soul — so they were cast out.”
● “Spain purified itself — and in doing so, it bled genius, craft, and spirit.”
● “Not by the sword alone, but by law, decree, and silence were they erased.”
● Complements Jewish Pogroms as a coordinated campaign of erasure — state-sanctioned,
ideologically driven, and devastatingly thorough.
● Contrasts with Ottoman Intercommunal Relations, where pluralism was institutionalized —
showing how different empires dealt with religious diversity in opposite ways.

## A Ritual Murder Trial of Jews in germany
Description: A scholarly reconstruction of the events that led to Jewish persecution in Germany
Type: Secondary?
### 1 - The Jews were to be seen as ritualistic animals
- "...but that Jews need Christian blood for circumcision." LIKE WHAT
- "The Initial rumor and gossip when the bodies of the murdered Christians were discovered... People Immediately suspected the jews"
### 2 - The trial was rigged from the beginning.
- "First, the guilt of the Jews was already assumed in the opening sentence 'One knows well that nobody else but the Jews had committed these crimes'"
- "The ubiquitous instrument of torture in europe before the French Revolution was the strappada, by which the suspect's hands were tied together behind his back witha  rope..... Apparently Eberlin broke down without actually undergoing torture, and the stronger Mercklin was also eventually reduced to confess."
- "While the jews tried steadfastly to maintain their innocence or broke down and confessed under fear and pain in this unequal power play."

- "The christians were slaughtered in Elias' shearing shed like innocent lambs, like Jesus victims of the bloodthirsty jews with their butcher knives"
- "The Public Execution itself served as a dramatric representation of the evil of Jews and teh Triumph of Christianity."
“The boy’s body was never whole again — but their blood made him whole in myth.”
"Confession under torture was no less sacred to the court than testimony under oath.”
“They did not just kill Jews — they sanctified the killing.”

● Source Type: Secondary (based on trial records and historical analysis)
● Empire & Timeframe: Holy Roman Empire (Germany), 1475 CE
● Comparison: Reinforces themes from Jewish Pogroms by illustrating the legal codification of
anti-Jewish violence; contrasts with Ottoman Intercommunal Relations, where religious
minorities were granted judicial autonomy and protection.
● Bishop of Trent
○ Enabled and legitimized false charges against Jews.
○ Confiscated property and elevated the case as a religious victory.
● Jewish Defendants
○ Confessed under torture to impossible crimes.
○ Were martyred in a spectacle of legalized fantasy.
● Simon of Trent (Mythologized Victim)
○ His death was politicized into a saintly miracle.
○ Became a tool for promoting anti-Jewish legends.

● Hsia recounts the trial and execution of Jews in Trent, accused of ritually murdering a
Christian boy named Simon — a textbook example of a “blood libel.”
● The case reflects deep-rooted anti-Semitic beliefs that Jews needed Christian blood for
religious rituals, a myth used to justify persecution across Europe.

● Torture was employed to extract confessions, and those statements were used to convict and
execute several members of the Jewish community.
● Despite inconsistent evidence, the court proceedings were treated as legitimate due to
widespread popular and clerical support for the accusations.
● The reading shows how ecclesiastical and secular courts colluded in reinforcing religious
fantasies as legal truth.
● Hsia argues that these trials served both symbolic and political functions — asserting Christian
dominance and punishing perceived blasphemy.
● The case of Simon of Trent became a saintly legend used to further anti-Jewish sentiment
across German territories.
● The bishop of Trent supported the charges and helped ensure that Jewish property was
confiscated after execution.
● Jewish women and children were subjected to forced baptism and exile, erasing community
identity in addition to life.
● “The boy’s body was never whole again — but their blood made him whole in myth.”
● “Confession under torture was no less sacred to the court than testimony under oath.”
● “They did not just kill Jews — they sanctified the killing.”
● Adds judicial weight to the violence in Jewish Pogroms — where mobs acted on fury, here
courts acted with sanction and ceremony.
● Sharp contrast to Ottoman Intercommunal Relations, where minority communities were
protected by legal boundaries — in Christian Europe, law itself became the weapon.
