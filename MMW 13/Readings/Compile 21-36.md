Description: A retrospective wide lens analysis on the European efforts to conquer the sea and trade routes to Africa
Type: Secondary
- Argues the primary motivation was spice, that Europe was largely unsuccessful in strongmanning the African coast, and had to concede to trade relations. Also argued that Iberia wasn't the only country that put effort into exploration.
### 1 - The Europeans were really sweating to try and expand
- "Thus, the actual motivation for European expansion and for navigational breakthroughs was little more than to exploit the opportunity for immediate profits made by raiding and the seizure of purchase of trade commodities."
- "Europeans clearly hoped that their maritime abilities would give them military advantages that would result in large profits and perhaps conquests. They were prepared to take over territory and enslave people, and their actions in the Canary islands bore witness to that desire."
	- "The inhabitants (of the Senegal Islands)... had little other recourse than to try and flee to areas of difficult access
- "(Africans couldn't fight Europeans at sea, Europeans couldn't effectively use naval on land). As a result, the Europeans had to abandon... trading and raiding and substitute a relationship based more or less completely on peaceful regulated trade"
### 2 - The unlocking of new nautical technologies helped finally traverse the previously impenetrable and slow channels,
- "In many ways, in the days of wooden sailing ships, the ocean was as much channeled as were rivers whose direction of flow was clearly defined. This was crucian for the development of Atlantic navigation, for the winds and currents created barriers to traffic for thousands of years."
- "(In response to commercial possibilities) the prospects of the next stretch of coast to produce the pepper known as Malaguetta pepper were known to Fernao Gomes, when he petitioned the Crown for exclusive rights to the trade of West Africa... In any case, his grant included a provision that he explore further sections of the coast, and his expeditions rapidly began exporting the pepper"
