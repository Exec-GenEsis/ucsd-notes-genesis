Description: A series of primary sources illustrating the political workings of the encomienda "Free Labor"
Type: Secondary 
- The Encomienda system was a system of forced labor that tried to act like it was an attempt to "Civlilize" the people. This was a purely economic goal for them.
### 1 - "The Encomenderos just kept asking man"
- "...and the Indians give every day two chickens and four loads of wood."
- "Also they are to make the plantings of peppers, beans, maize, and wheat as stated"
- "(in 1558) from now on for a period of eight years the natives of the said town are to give in tribute to the said encomenderos each year 286 common gold pesos paid three times a year."
	- "(Then, in 1565) ordered that the natives give in tribute each year 964 gold pesos and seven tomines of common gold, the payments are to be made three times a year.
	- Obligations kept changing
- "And they are not to be taxed or assessed or required to pay more tribute...."(1558)
	- Repeated in some form every other encomienda, suggesting the Indians kept pushing back.
### 2 - All the legislation to prevent encomendero abuse, especially to indians was hella ignored
- "...because they said they did not want to give them since the macehuelas would not serve as carriers, he took them by their hair and gave them many kicks, calling them dogs and sons of whores"
	- An account of a court proceeding complaining against Juan Ponce, showed that these guys did not care at all.
- "... their master increased the amount they were obligated to give by half, and they have given him this for eight years without being paid for it."
- "Also, the last sunday, the said Juan Ponce ordered the macebuelas to bring they wheat they are obligated to give, and because they did this they did not hear Mass"
	- Shows how they couldn't hide behind religious tones here, and also an appeal to their Christian sympathizers. o

**Connections to Lecture Outline:**

- **Encomienda System as Exploitative Labor Control**
    
    - Both the source and the outline highlight the encomienda as a system that claimed to protect and Christianize Natives but in reality functioned to extract labor and resources, directly connecting to the outline's section on **Conquistador Rationale for Economic Exploitation**.
        
- **Crown's Legal Reforms and Ineffectiveness**
    
    - The reading discusses royal laws (like the Laws of Burgos and New Laws) intended to regulate labor abuses—paralleling the lecture’s point about **The Crown’s Compromise** through regulation that often failed in practice.
        
- **Repartimiento and Demographic Collapse**
    
    - The exploitation through systems like the **repartimiento** and its impact on Native populations is emphasized in both the text and your lecture’s **Silver and the Mercantilist Logic** section.
