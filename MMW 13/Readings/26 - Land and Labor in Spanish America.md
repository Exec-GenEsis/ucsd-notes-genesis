**Connections to Lecture Outline:**

- **Encomienda System as Exploitative Labor Control**
    
    - Both the source and the outline highlight the encomienda as a system that claimed to protect and Christianize Natives but in reality functioned to extract labor and resources, directly connecting to the outline's section on **Conquistador Rationale for Economic Exploitation**.
        
- **Crown's Legal Reforms and Ineffectiveness**
    
    - The reading discusses royal laws (like the Laws of Burgos and New Laws) intended to regulate labor abuses—paralleling the lecture’s point about **The Crown’s Compromise** through regulation that often failed in practice.
        
- **Repartimiento and Demographic Collapse**
    
    - The exploitation through systems like the **repartimiento** and its impact on Native populations is emphasized in both the text and your lecture’s **Silver and the Mercantilist Logic** section.
