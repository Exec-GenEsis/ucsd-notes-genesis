Author: Ibn Battuta

Time/Place: 1325-1354, primarily Delhi, India

Primary or secondary source?: Primary

Aim: Catalogue of life in India, including the oppression of the Hindu people and the sultan’s kindness and cruelty.

Approach: Battuta records life in India through excerpts of its sultan (someone who he says is compassionate to the people, but also ‘all too ready to shed blood’), his experience getting there, and the stories he hears (such as one about the sultan exiling all Hindus and killing those who refused to make the 40 day journey to the Dawalt Abad, such as a blind Hindu man who was dragged behind a cart). He also mentions briefly witnessing sati and being attacked by infidels on his way into the city.

Summary/Main Ideas (“takeaways”): The Hindu people were violently oppressed by the sultan in Delhi, and sultan was simultaneously powerful, generous, and cruel
