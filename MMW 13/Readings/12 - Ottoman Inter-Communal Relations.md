- **The Ottoman empire is successful and, in its early years, was highly religiously tolerant and has systems in place to create a power structure that allows anyone with merit to have power, regardless of prior status.**

Time/Place: Ottoman empire (centered in Turkey), between 1500 and 1922 

Primary or secondary source?: Secondary source 

Aim: to educate people on the relationship between Jews, Christans, and Muslims in the Ottoman empire, also to debunk the myth that things between them were always hostile. That is a modern idea put onto people in that region, long after this time of peace. 

Approach: 

Summary/Main Ideas (“takeaways”): That Jews, Christians, and Muslims all co-existed in the Ottoman empire and even helped each other out. The empire was mainly under Muslim rule, but they allowed for jews and christians to live there. Providing sanctuary and an escape in situations like underage marriage. Jews or Christians could go to Muslims and ask them to get out of having to go into an unwanted marriage due to muslim laws that required the women's permission for marriage.**
