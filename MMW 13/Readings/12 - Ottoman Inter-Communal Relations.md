Aim: to educate people on the relationship between Jews, Christans, and Muslims in the Ottoman empire, also to debunk the myth that things between them were always hostile. That is a modern idea put onto people in that region, long after this time of peace. 

Approach: 

Summary/Main Ideas (“takeaways”): 

## 1 - That Jews, Christians, and Muslims all co-existed in the Ottoman empire and even helped each other out. 
- The empire was mainly under Muslim rule, but they allowed for jews and christians to live there. 
	- "In Khaskovo, our neighbors are Turks. They were good neighbors. They got on well together.... My mother was alone with four children. And the neighbors said "You're not going anywhere... you'll stay with is..." So mama stayed with the Turks.... What I'm trying to tell you is we lived well with these people.
	- Yet, in a real sense, the military obligation had become a muslim one. (Long explanation on how christians fled whne they were required service).. Thus, subjects understood that Muslims needed to fight but non muslims did not.
- Providing sanctuary and an escape in situations like underage marriage. Jews or Christians could go to Muslims and ask them to get out of having to go into an unwanted marriage due to muslim laws that required the women's permission for marriage.
	- Muslim courts often provided rights to Christains and Jews that were unavailable in their own courts.
	- Thus, persons who feared disinheritance or a smaller share in the will of a Christian or Jew placed themselves under Islamic law. 
	- Christian widows frequently registered in the Islamic courts because these provided a grater share to the wife of the deceased.
