Description: An account of a Spanish encomendero turned Catholic essentially ratting out the immorality and depravity that the Indies were being treated with
Type: Primary or Secondary?
- Scholarly Argument present?
### 1 - The Indies were perfectly willing to be Christianized, and they were good people
- "And of all the infinite universe of humanity, these people are the most guileless, the most devoid of wickedness and duplicity, the most obedient and faithful to their native masters and to the Spanish christians whom the my serve" (In describing the population of the Indies that they encountered) 
- "...docile and open to doctrine, very apt to receive our holy Catholic faith... And once they begin to hear the tidings of the Faith, they are so insistent on knowing more and on taking the sacraments of the Church and on observing the divine cult that, truly, the missionaries who are here need to be endowed by God with great patience in order to cope with such eagerness." (on the contrary to the slave tending nature the Indies were described by) 
### 2 - - The Spanish did not respect god nor the king
- "...nothing was done to incline the Indians to embrace the one true Faith, they were rounded up and in large numbers forced to do so... They are told they must embrace the Christian faith immediately; without hearing any sermon preached and without any indoctrination

**Connections to Lecture Outline:**

- **Personal Transformation from Encomendero to Reformer**
    
    - The reading narrates De Las Casas’s shift after witnessing Native suffering, directly matching the lecture's section on **De Las Casas’s Personal Background** and moral awakening.
        
- **Condemnation of Conquistadores’ Indifference to Conversion**
    
    - De Las Casas’s critique that the Spanish cared as little for preaching to Natives as to "dogs or other beasts" mirrors the lecture’s quotation and criticism of **perfunctory conversion**.
        
- **Appeal to Spanish Crown for Reform**
    
    - His direct petitions to the monarchy, including influence on the **New Laws of 1542**, align with your outline’s mention of his **Appeal to King Philip II** and efforts to reform Spanish colonial policy.
