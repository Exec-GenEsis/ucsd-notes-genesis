Description: King Alfonso II's troubles with European dickishness as related to the Spanish Slave Trade
Type: Primary
### 1 - The Spanish trade is toxic asf
- "...since this is caused by the excessive freedom given by your agents and officials to the men and merchants who are allowed to come tot this kingdom to set up shops with goods and many things which have been prohibited by us. "
- "And to avoid it we need from your kingdoms no more than some priests and a few people to teach in schools, and no other goods except wine and flour for the holy sacrament"
### 2 - The Slave trade just keeps taking our people
- "Your people,... seize many of our people, free and exempt ment, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and the sons of noblemen, and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our Kingdoms."
