19) Travels in Asia and Africa, 1325-1354, excerpts

Author: [Ibn Battuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Battuta)

Time/Place: 1325-1354, primarily Delhi, India

Primary or secondary source?: Primary

Aim: Catalogue of life in India, including the oppression of the Hindu people and the sultan’s kindness and cruelty.

Approach: Battuta records life in India through excerpts of its sultan (someone who he says is compassionate to the people, but also ‘all too ready to shed blood’), his experience getting there, and the stories he hears (such as one about the sultan exiling all Hindus and killing those who refused to make the 40 day journey to the Dawalt Abad, such as a blind Hindu man who was dragged behind a cart). He also mentions briefly witnessing sati and being attacked by infidels on his way into the city.

Summary/Main Ideas (“takeaways”): The Hindu people were violently oppressed by the sultan in Delhi, and sultan was simultaneously powerful, generous, and cruel

20) “Akbar and Religion”

Author: [Bada’Uni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BDAbd_al-Qadir_Badayuni)

Time/Place: 1558-1605, northern India

Primary or secondary source?: Primary

Aim: Akbar was interested in the beliefs of various faiths and invited high-ranking religious officials into his palace to talk to him about their beliefs and was overall, highly religiously tolerant (something one of his Muslim advisors/the author of this text disliked). 

Approach: Bada’Uni writes various stories about Akbar’s meetings with other groups from Jews, to Hindu brahmins, to Buddhist yogis, Hindu and Buddhist ascetics, even Fathers from Europe

Summary/Main Ideas (“takeaways”): Akbar was a religiously tolerant ruler of Northern India who made special efforts to include the previously oppressed Hindus
