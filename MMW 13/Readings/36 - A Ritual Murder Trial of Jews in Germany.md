### 2 - The trial was rigged from the beginning.
- "First, the guilt of the Jews was already assumed in the opening sentence 'One knows well that nobody else but the Jews had committed these crimes'"
- "The ubiquitous instrument of torture in europe before the French Revolution was the strappada, by which the suspect's hands were tied together behind his back witha  rope..... Apparently Eberlin broke down without actually undergoing torture, and the stronger Mercklin was also eventually reduced to confess."
- "While the jews tried steadfastly to maintain their innocence or broke down and confessed under fear and pain in this unequal power play."

- "The christians were slaughtered in Elias' shearing shed like innocent lambs, like Jesus victims of the bloodthirsty jews with their butcher knives"
- "The Public Execution itself served as a dramatric representation of the evil of Jews and teh Triumph of Christianity."
“The boy’s body was never whole again — but their blood made him whole in myth.”
"Confession under torture was no less sacred to the court than testimony under oath.”
“They did not just kill Jews — they sanctified the killing.”
