Description: Morris Rossabi's analysis and summarization of the Mongol's "Yuan Dynasty" over China, with a focus on Muslim contributions and subsequent "sacking" as a power check and power move. 
Type: Secondary
- Scholarly Argument
	- 
### 1 - Muslims were a heavy, possibly controversially effective, workforce in the taxation system
- Controversial choice of Khubilai to employ Ahmad as finance minister. Lil bro taxed heavy on the Chinitos and Chinitas using land tax, state monopolization on copper tools, tea, liquor, vinegar, gold, silver. Also a guy who supposedly participated in nepotism, political subterfuge, etc. 
	- But, all we have are the opposition's perspective, so difficult to know to what extent he was actually bad. After his assassination, hella obvious planting of diamond in his quarters. 
	- Secondary perspective that this characterization was for mongol benefit. "Hey this dude was the source of your struggle and we got rid of him (ignore we hired him)"
- Ahmad also contributed in importing beasts of burden to form a "Postal System" across China, allowing for an "Export economy" especially and notably in silks, ceramics and spices. Importing traders needed to convert to cash first, which was hella cash muns, allowing for enough cash influx to start loans.
