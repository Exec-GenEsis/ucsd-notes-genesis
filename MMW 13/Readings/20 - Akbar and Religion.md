Aim: Akbar was interested in the beliefs of various faiths and invited high-ranking religious officials into his palace to talk to him about their beliefs and was overall, highly religiously tolerant (something one of his Muslim advisors/the author of this text disliked). 

Approach: Bada’Uni writes various stories about Akbar’s meetings with other groups from Jews, to Hindu brahmins, to Buddhist yogis, Hindu and Buddhist ascetics, even Fathers from Europe
