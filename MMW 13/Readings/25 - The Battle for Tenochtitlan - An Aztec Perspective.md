Description: Bernardino de Sahagun was a member of the Franciscan Order and an early Spanish missionary in Mexico. He learned the language the Aztecs used and wanted to preserve the memory of their culture â€” this was opposed by fellow Spanairds who thought this got in the way of Christianization

### 1 - The Spanish were greedy mfers
- "Like monkeys they grabbed the gold.... For gold was what they greatly thirsted for; they were gluttonous for it, starved for it, piggishly wanting it."
- Example 2
### 2 - The Spanish were brutal asf, directly and indirectly
- "They struck a drummers arms; both of his hands were severed. Then they struck his neck; his head landed far away. Then they stabbed everyone with iron lances and struck them with iron swords. They struck some in the belly, and then their entrails came spilling out. They split open the heads of some, they really cut their skulls to pieces.... Those who tried to escape could go nowhere. When anyone tried to go out, at the entryway they struck and stabbed him."
- "(On Diseases) First an epidemic broke out, a sickness of pustules... Large bumps spread on people, some were entirely covered... The disease brought great desolation; a great many died of it."
- "(On the wall blocking to Xoloco) They fired the big guns at it. At the first shot it did not give way, but the second time it began to crumble. The third time, at last parts of it fell to the ground, and the fourth time finally the wall went to the ground once and for all"

## 3 - The Mexican-Spanish Technology and warfare disparity was massive
- "They came out and chased the Spaniards in the passageway, and when the Spaniards saw it they, the Mexica, seemed to be Intoxicated"
	- Man, the Mexicans were drunk, still a more primitive way of fighting.
- "And when the sacrifice was over, they strung the Spaniards heads on poles on skill racks."
- "and in early august the Aztecs decided to send into battle a quetzal-owl warrior, whose success or failure, it was believed, would reveal if the gods wished the Aztecs to continue the war"
	- Like seriously these guys were out of food, water, they were drunk, stuck on rituals, this was brutal.
- "Let him wear it, let him die in it. Let him dazzle people with it, let him show them something; let our enemies see and admire it... And the reason they did this was that was as though the fate of the rulers of the Mexica were being determined"
