Description: An account of the Portugese's Intrusion of the 
Type: Primary or Secondary?
- Scholarly Argument present?
### 1 - The Portugese were received with relative kindness and respect.
- "He excused himself from coming, but sent the Grand-Captain gifts instead; They were five goats, a small cow and a large number of coconuts and other fruit,"
	- I mean come on, showing up one day and demanding audience is crazy work. In a way Kilwa's actions can be disrespectful, but not murder disrespectful. You don't just do that without a motive.
- "There came out a Spanish Christian who was living there...He told the Christians to go away.... but that if they were keen to come ashore the people were ready to set about them for their supper. "
	- Mombasa knew what the Portugese were going to do, so they already start fighting. Even so, they still offered to truce and set them with supper
### 2 - The Portugese really were more concerned with plundering the cities
- "This flag had been left by the admiral [Vasco de Gama] when he had arranged for Kilwa to pay a tribute of 1500 ounces of gold a year."
	- The key thing to remember here is that they were doing this via force - Kilwa owed the Portugese nothing but were forced to be under a tyrant.
- "The Grand-Captain ordered that the town should be sacked and that each man should carry of to his ship whatever he found: so that at the end there would be a division of spoil, each man to receive a twentieth of what he found."
	- The fact that these people also just motivated themselves on the fact that they could plunder for their own gain is CRAAAZY WORK.
