Description: Excerpts from Gaspar Correa, who sailed with Vasco de Gama, detailing an incident after a group of Portugese were killed in a trading station of Calcutta
Type: Primary
### 1 - The Portugese were a vengeous kind, even thought hey were the ones who are encroaching.
- "He then ordered all the fleet to draw in close to the shore, and all day, till night, he bombarde the city, by which he made a great destruction"
- "Then the captain-major commanded them to cut off the hands and ears and noses of all the crews, and put all that into one of the small vessels..."
	- He then goes on to tie them all up, lug them into a boat, and have the boat set on fire.
	- The vessel with ears, with the friar, is sent to the shore. 
	- Note that this is a fear tactic, to be taken as a sign of what happens when you mess with the Portugese trade.
