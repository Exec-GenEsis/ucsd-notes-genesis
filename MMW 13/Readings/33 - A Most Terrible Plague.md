### 1 - The Plague completely overwhelmed the people of Florence
- "In spite of all the means that art and human foresight could suggest, such as keeping the city clear from filth, the exclusion of all suspected persons, and the publication of copious instructions for the preservation of health... it began to show itself in the spring of the aforesaid year (1348)"
	- Remembering that the relative "best" practices the people of this time knew, from decades of study and experience, could not make a dent on the start and spread of the plague would have been terrifying. 
- "To the cure of this malady., neither medicinal knowledge nor the power of drugs was of any effect; whether because the disease was in its own nature mortal, or that the physicians... could form no just idea of the cause, nor consequently devise a true method of cure"
	- Despite the advancements in Science and the Medicines, the true nature of the Black Death was a challenge way over the ability of the people of the time to conquer.  
- "Whichever was the reason, few escaped; but nearly all died the third day from the first appearance of the symptoms, some sooner, some later, without any fever or accessory symptoms"

- "A third sort of people chose a method between these two.... eating and drinking what their appetites required, they walked everywhere with [fragrances and nose-coverings]"
### 3 - People started to prioritize themselves and the present. Full survival instincts
- "For their terror was such, that a brother even fled from his brother, a wife from her husband, and, what is more uncommon, a parent from their own child."
	- Analysis and connection to theme
- "You might see the poor distressed labourers... without either the aid of physicians, or help of servants, languishing on the highways, in the fields, and in their own hoises, and dying rather like cattle than human creatures. The consequence was that.... care"
