Key Focus:  
1) What stimulated trade in West Africa before the European intervention?  
2) What was the extent of wealth and influence in West African kingdoms?

## The Advent of the Trans-Saharan Trade  
Pre-5th century C.E. Scenario  
- Slow and infrequent—relied mostly on pack-oxen  

Transport Breakthrough in 5th century C.E.  
- The Camel Revolution  
	- Able to travel twice as fast and twice as far as pack-oxen  
	- Perfectly adapted to the desert—e.g. sealable nostrils for the ghiblis  
- Role of Berbers—the Sanhaja and the Taureg  

The Mediterranean-Sahel Link  
- “Sahel”—Arabic word for “shore”  
- Network of desert “littoral” cities—Walata, Timbuktu, Gao, Djenne, Kumbi-Saleh  
##  The First West African Kingdom—Ghana (10th to 12th centuries)  
Historical Background  
- Strategically located between Sahara desert and forests of the Niger and Senegal  
- Soninke People with capital at Kumbi-Saleh  
	- Access to iron tools, weapons, and horses from the Mediterranean  
	- Conduit of trade between desert salt mines at Taghaza (Western Sahara) and goldfields of Bambuk (Upper Senegal River)  

The Gold Trade  
- By 8th and 9th centuries, safer, less subject to raids  
	- Wealth of Ghanaian kingdom directly paralleled expansion of trade  
- Soninke position as “middlemen” in this lucrative trade  
	- Tariffs on salt going in and out of Kumbi Saleh  
	- King kept all the gold nuggets—traded gold dust  
- The gold harvesters of Bambuk  
	- Accounts from Al-Bakri, an 11th century geographer of Cordoba  

Kumbi-Saleh in the 11th century  
- Consisted of two towns  
	- One for Muslims, other for the King  
	- Area rich in resources—farming and fishing supported a large population  
- Social Stratification  
	- Royal family did not convert  
	- Trade was only accessible to a small elite group  

Decline of Ghana in 13th Century  
- First, rise of the Almoravids—an extremist Islamic tribe in North Africa 
	- Insisted on their version of Shari-a, started a jihad against locals
	- Interruption of caravans weakened the Ghanaian trade economy  
- Second, environmental duress?
- Last, discovery of new gold fields farther east—Bure  

## The Aura of African Wealth and Power—Mali Empire (13th to 14th Century)

Historical Background  
- Mandinka People—chiefs had converted to Islam as early as 11th century - *al Musalmani*

Extent of Empire  
- System of vassalage
