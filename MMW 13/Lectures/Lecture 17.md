Outline Lecture Seventeen—The Rise of Anti-Semitic Persecution in Germany

Main Thesis: The extent to which a community allows seeds of discrimination and prejudice to fester in times of relative stability and peace will generally predetermine how violently it responds when crisis erupts

I)	The Mechanism of Persecution
a)	The “Innocuous” Seeds of Prejudice
i)	A culture of persecution often may seem relatively mild, trivial, and harmless
ii)	But when crisis occurs, persecution can reach horrific proportions
b)	Need to understand persecution “historically”?
i)	How it can be reinforced by stereotypes, jokes, rumors, customs, etc.
ii)	Key is to examine the social mechanism behind persecution

II)	The Trial of Endingen in 1470
a)	The setting—three Jewish brothers accused of ritual murder and executed
i)	Emperor Frederick III’s stern letter of rebuke in the aftermath
(1)	Should not have tried and executed Jews without imperial sanction
(2)	Ultimately, more out of concern for Habsburg authority than justice for Jews
b)	Political Implications in the 15th century Breisgau Valley
i)	German townships and Swiss cantons in the Vorderostericch (Further Austria) 
(1)	Actively contested Habsburg jurisdiction over local political and legal matters
(2)	Tolerance for Jews reminded them of their subservience to Habsburg authority
(3)	Jews became pawns in contest between Habsburg rule and German defiance
c)	Circumstances Behind the Accusation
i)	Discovery in 1470 in a collapsed charnel house
ii)	How could they have jumped to such unfounded conclusion?
(1)	Jews as enemies of Christ
(a)	Worshipped in the “Synagogue of Satan”—cult rituals and orgies
(b)	“Ritual murder” myth
(2)	Stigma of Victimhood
d)	Guilty Verdict from the Outset
i)	Brothers not innocent until proven guilty, but guilty by virtue of being a Jew
ii)	Confessions extracted from torture
(1)	Mercklin’s “confession” as to “Why was Christian blood needed?”
(2)	Likely threatened with common torture called strappada
iii)	Why circumcision accepted as motive?
e)	Fabrication of a Conspiracy 
i)	Building the case for a Jewish “conspiracy”
ii)	Significance: Blame it on a cultural, religious practice ubiquitous to all Jews
(1)	Treat murder as religious evil of Judaism, not as secular crime
iii)	So that Endingen can finally be “Juden Frei” or “Jew Free”
f)	The “Spill-over Effect” of Endingen
i)	Set legal precedent for other cases of anti-Semitic persecution
ii)	Last but not least, “story becoming history”
