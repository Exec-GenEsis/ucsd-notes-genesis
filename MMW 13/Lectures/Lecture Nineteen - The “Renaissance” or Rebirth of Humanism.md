 Key Focus:  
1) The key assumptions of Humanism and how they depart from those of Scholasticism  
2) Socio-political and cultural implications of the Renaissance  
## Medieval Synthesis or Rational Scholasticism  
Rebirth of the Classical Tradition
- Reintroduced to Europe by Spanish Islamic and Byzantine scholars  
- Universities as the natural home for study of these texts  

Tradition of Scholasticism  
- What was a scholar’s role?  
- Commentary and new methodology always a slippery slope
	- The public perception of "Truth" had to be changed.

Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)  
- Synthesized Aristotelian philosophy and Christian Theology  
- “Summa Theological” as epitome of Medieval Synthesis  
	- God as a Prime Mover and First Cause
	- God is the only being “having of itself its own necessity”  

## The Rise of Humanism  
The Curriculum of Humanism  
- In addition to history, moral philosophy, and rhetoric, study of poetry and oration as a sort of celebration
	- Key departure from Scholasticism
	- Synthesis with Religion
		- As beautiful as humanity is, it can only logically be attributed to God/
- Pico Della Mirandola’s (1463-1494) “Oration on the Dignity of Man”  
	- Departure from Aquinas  
	- Eulogy for humanity based not on logic but on eloquence
	- Celebration of humanity
		- Envy of even the angels, due to humanity's lack of prescribed and fixed role.
			- We get to decide what becomes of us
		- “Indeterminate form” and “chameleon” figure
			- We can transform ourselves to become the worst or best of our reality.
				- Self-determination.
- Marsilio Ficino: “Man is a kind of God,” capable of “transforming himself into God, as if he were God himself”
	- Expansion of Mirandola's ideas.

## Renaissance Art and the Ideology of Control  
The “discovery” of linear perspective  
- Transposing three-dimensional space rationally onto two-dimensional canvas  
	- Using fixed vanishing point and vantage point to configure scene in logical order  
- Artist becomes the seer and organizer of reality “as if he were God himself”

Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446)  
 - Contrast to Gothic style
	 - Gothic Style - Dark, detailed, dizzying
		 - Inspiring a sense of mysticism through sensing that mystery, and reasoning that feeling to be an affirmation of God's existence.
		- Transcendental - Senses overwhelmed that you might transcend to heaven
	- Renaissance Style - Feeling evoked by Renaissance architecture is “one of intellectual control, not mystic transcendence”  
		- Symmetrical, ordered, monotonic nature symbolic of God and his creation.
	- E.g. Duomo; Baptistry of Santa Maria; Interior of San Lorenzo
		- Duomo - basically believed that buildings played a role in inspiring civic responsibility, order.
			- Have the power to make people more virtuous citizens.
			- Architecture should be informed by what reason informs you to do

Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472)  
- Public buildings can and should inspire citizens towards greater virtue and civic responsibility  
- Urban space as rational expression of social order, symmetry, and control

Social Implications of Renaissance Rationalism  
- Renaissance was nurtured in the cradle of despotism
	- Florence, Genoa, Milan were all merchant dictatorships  
	- City-states dominated by the likes of the Medici family  
	- Seeds of totalitarian ideology embedded in Renaissance urban design and its emphasis on control  
- Teleological paradigm for historical perspective  
	- “History as a series of temporal planes corresponding to the spatial planes defined by linear perspective”  
	- Ideas such as Manifest Destiny, Divine Providence, etc.  
- Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519) and the “Conquest of Nature”  
	- Consummate “Renaissance Man”  
		- Skilled in art, music, science, literature  
	- Exercise dominion over nature
		- “Show men how to remove mountains with ease, and how to bore them in order to pass from one level to another”  
	- To “represent” nature is simultaneously to “conquer” it  
- Impact on the West’s ecological perspective  
	- Marsilio Ficino: “Man as the vicar of God” to rule and use nature
