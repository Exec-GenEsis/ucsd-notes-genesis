## A Miraculous Conquest?  
Traditional Emphasis Regarding the Conquest  
- How could a few hundred conquistadors topple well-established empires?  
	- Fatalism of Moctezuma?

## Contingent Factors Behind the Spanish Conquest of the Aztecs  
Aztec Decline by early 1500s  
- Aztec empire had been sustained on a much-despised tributary system  
- Vicious cycle of decline  
	- As areas for expansion dwindled, bounty from conquests diminished  
	- More blood needed to revitalize the waning energy of the sun (Ritual explanation)
- Spaniards exploited the fractures within the crumbling Aztec system  

Experience subjugating native populations  
- Canary Islands  
- For three decades, decimation of the Taino and Arawak people of the Caribbean  
	- 4 million in 1492 down to a few thousand in 1540s  

Advantages of Desperation  
- Like Portugal, Spain was on the fringe of Mediterranean commercial wealth  
- The conquistadors themselves usually were from the margins of Iberian nobility  
- Prior to 1519, only 1/3 of those who had crossed the Atlantic survived
