Key Questions:  
1) What challenges did the nomadic Mongol rulers face in managing a sedentary, multi-  
ethnic society like that of China?  
2) How did they try to overcome them?

## Khubilai Khan: From Nomad to Emperor of China  
The Four Khanates  
- After Genghis khan’s death in 1227, empire divided into four administrative regions  
	- To the West—Il-khans in Persia (Hulegu overthrew the Abbasids in 1258)  
	- To the Northwest—The Golden Horde in Russia (Berke)  
	- Central Asia—Khanate of Chagatai  
	- To the East—Great Khanate in Mongolian heartland and China (Khubilai)  

Khubilai’s Rise to Power  
- Elected Great Khan after his older brother died suddenly in 1260  
- Challenegd by another younger brother Arigh Boke  
- Between 1260-1264, costly and lengthy campaigns to suppress this challenge  
	- Victory derived from controlling food from Arigh Boke as opposed to any battle
	- Needed to re-invent himself into a committed sovereign of a sedentary society

Economic Recovery under Khubilai  
- Devastation of northern China from previous wars  
- Emergency measures  
	- Establish Office for the Stimulation of Agriculture in 1261
	- Ended tax farming and pro-farming relief policies
	- Autonomous village organizations called she
- Records show Khubilai to be a well-informed, hands-on executive  
	- Resourceful, pragmatic in use of advisors of all faiths and ethnicities
		- As well as recruiting of advisors and workers, choosing confucian and buddhist, christians, anyone with expertise.
	- Delegated responsibility broadly so as to avoid reliance on one group  

Boost commercial infrastructure  
- Support for the Muslim-run merchant associations—known as ortakhs  
	- Financial middle-men—funding from Mongol elites -> loans to merchants
		- So as to redirect social burden and stigma of "debt collecting"
		- Also shifted blame to merchants for conversion into currency
			- *See "Paper Currency"*
	- Enjoyed laissez-faire policy via low taxes and tarrifs
- Paper currency  
	- All merchants had to convert gold or silver to paper currency  
	- Why inflation did not get out of hand  
- Postal Stations or Yambs  
	- System first set up by Ogodei Khan  
	- 25 miles apart/ 200 to 400 fresh horses at the ready  
	- About 50k horses for message relay
## The Making of a “Global” Sovereign  
A “global” and cosmopolitan sovereign with pragmatic sensibilities  
- Appreciation for not just the symbolism but the function of diversity  
- Recruited and used talented experts from the entire Mongol realm  
	- E.g. Jamal al-Din and Kuo Shou-ching, his Chinese counterpart  
	- E.g. Yeh-hsi-tieh-erh, Muslim architect, to lead construction of Da-du  
	- E.g. The Case of the Polos  
- Had an almost modern awareness of the power of image-making  
	- Dual identity as the Great Khan of the Mongols, but also as the Yuan emperor of his Chinese subjects. 

Establishment of the hierarchy of four ethnic classes
- Mongols, Semuren, Hanren, Nanren  

Reliance on Foreign Administrators  
- The Case of Ahmad  
	- Finance czar from 1262-1282  
	- Strong fiscal measures he took  
- The Case of Saiyid Ajall  
	- Appointed governor of strategic new territory of Yunnan in 1274  
	- Why choose an old Muslim for such a key post?  
	- Achievements as governor  

The Adverse Impact of Global Politics on Mongol-Muslim Relations  
- Geopolitical developments in 1270-1280 affecting domestic policy  
	- Threat of Islamic power  
	- Anti-Muslim decrees or jasaghs  
- Was this the cumulative effect of anti-Muslim sentiments in China?  
	- E.g. Christian official Ai-xue’s relentless sabotaging of Muslims
