Main Thesis: The extent to which a community allows seeds of discrimination and prejudice to fester in times of relative stability and peace will generally predetermine how violently it responds when crisis erupts

## The Mechanism of Persecution
The “Innocuous” Seeds of Prejudice
- A culture of persecution often may seem relatively mild, trivial, and harmless
- But when crisis occurs, persecution can reach horrific proportions

Need to understand persecution “historically”?
- How it can be reinforced by stereotypes, jokes, rumors, customs, etc.
- Key is to examine the social mechanism behind persecution

## The Trial of Endingen in 1470
The setting—three Jewish brothers accused of ritual murder and executed
- Emperor Frederick III’s stern letter of rebuke in the aftermath
	- Should not have tried and executed Jews without imperial sanction
	- Ultimately, more out of concern for Habsburg authority than justice for Jews

Political Implications in the 15th century Breisgau Valley
- German townships and Swiss cantons in the Vorderostericch (Further Austria) 
	- Actively contested Habsburg jurisdiction over local political and legal matters
	- Tolerance for Jews reminded them of their subservience to Habsburg authority
	- Jews became pawns in contest between Habsburg rule and German defiance

Circumstances Behind the Accusation
- Discovery in 1470 in a collapsed charnel house
- How could they have jumped to such unfounded conclusion?
	- Jews as enemies of Christ
		- Worshipped in the “Synagogue of Satan”—cult rituals and orgies
		- “Ritual murder” myth
	- Stigma of Victimhood

Guilty Verdict from the Outset
- Brothers not innocent until proven guilty, but guilty by virtue of being a Jew
- Confessions extracted from torture
	- Mercklin’s “confession” as to “Why was Christian blood needed?”
	- Likely threatened with common torture called strappada
- Why circumcision accepted as motive?

Fabrication of a Conspiracy 
- Building the case for a Jewish “conspiracy”
	- Significance: Blame it on a cultural, religious practice ubiquitous to all Jews
- Treat murder as religious evil of Judaism, not as secular crime
- So that Endingen can finally be “Juden Frei” or “Jew Free”

The “Spill-over Effect” of Endingen
- Set legal precedent for other cases of anti-Semitic persecution
- Last but not least, “story becoming history”
