Key Focus:
1)     What were the economic driving forces behind the slave trade?
2)     What were some of its global repercussions?

## The Origin of the Atlantic Slave Trade
Slavery Prior to 1400
- In the 8th century, the word “slave” derived from ethnic reference “Slav”
- Key differences between pre-15th century and post-15th century slavery
	- First, ratio of slaves to free people in pre-15th century societies very low
	- Second, slave status hardly ever defined by a person’s race
- How did new type of slave enterprise arise?

The Sugar Connection
- A cultural consequence of the Crusades
- Developed Atlantic “sugar islands”
- By mid-1500s, Brazil would eclipse Atlantic islands as main supplier of sugar

c)     The Economics of Plantation Societies

i)      Multinational enterprises

(1)   Required massive capital investment:

(2)   Transport of slaves and goods

ii)    Introduced industrial-style mass production

(1)   Followed a **_capital_**-intensive vs. **_labor_**-intensive logic

(a)   Slaves treated as “factory machines” not “human workers” per se

(b)   More “economical” to replace than to sustain this labor resource

(2)   This logic most pervasive in South America and the Caribbean

(a)   Prohibition against slave households

(3)   For Europeans, important precursor for the Industrial Revolution?

(a)   Roots of proto-capitalism in slave-based plantations?

iii)   Plantation economies also anticipated subversion against blatant exploitation

(1)   Resistance from slaves in places like Brazil, Jamaica, Dutch Surinam

(2)   Slave Revolt in Haiti 1792

## The Global Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade

a)     The Triangular Trade of the Atlantic

i)      “Engine” that would propel Europe towards the Industrial Revolution?

ii)    Created “great wealth for few, great misery for many”

b)     “Refinement of Cruelty”

i)      Olaudah Equiano’s chronicles

ii)    Descriptions of the loading of slaves and “The Middle Passage”

(1)   Thomas Phillips in 1694—captain of the _Hannibal_

(a)   Africans “as much as the works of God’s hands”

(b)   Yet, fully embraced a paternalistic, colonial rationale

c)     Estimate of Numbers

i)      From 1500 to 1870, roughly 12 million African slaves made it alive to the Americas

ii)    Africa’s population attrition should easily exceed 25 million

d)     Long-term Impact of the Slave Trade on Africa

i)      Geopolitical Power Shifts

(1)   General destabilization and depopulation of the region

(a)   King Afonso’s plea to Portuguese Crown 1526

(2)   Power shifts from inland Sub-Saharan kingdoms to tropical coast states

(a)   Brutal, aggressive _native_ regimes driven by greed to meet demand for slaves

ii)    Effect on Economic Productivity

(1)   Depletion of young men of reproductive age in West Africa

(2)   Productive human resources exchanged for non-productive luxury items

(3)   Lasting impact on Africa’s inability to catch up to the industrial world?

iii)   Explanations for the Rise of the West
