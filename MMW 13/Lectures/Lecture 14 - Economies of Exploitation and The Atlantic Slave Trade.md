Key Focus:
1)     What were the economic driving forces behind the slave trade?
2)     What were some of its global repercussions?

## The Origin of the Atlantic Slave Trade
Slavery Prior to 1400
- In the 8th century, the word “slave” derived from ethnic reference “Slav”
- Key differences between pre-15th century and post-15th century slavery
	- First, ratio of slaves to free people in pre-15th century societies very low
	- Second, slave status hardly ever defined by a person’s race
- How did new type of slave enterprise arise?

The Sugar Connection
- A cultural consequence of the Crusades
- Developed Atlantic “sugar islands”
- By mid-1500s, Brazil would eclipse Atlantic islands as main supplier of sugar

The Economics of Plantation Societies
- Multinational enterprises
	- Required massive capital investment:
	- Transport of slaves and goods
- Introduced industrial-style mass production
	- Followed a capital-intensive vs. labor-intensive logic
		- Slaves treated as “factory machines” not “human workers” per se
		- More “economical” to replace than to sustain this labor resource
	- This logic most pervasive in South America and the Caribbean
		- Prohibition against slave households
	- For Europeans, important precursor for the Industrial Revolution?
		- Roots of proto-capitalism in slave-based plantations?
- Plantation economies also anticipated subversion against blatant exploitation
	- Resistance from slaves in places like Brazil, Jamaica, Dutch Surinam
	- Slave Revolt in Haiti 1792

## The Global Impact of the Atlantic Slave Trade

The Triangular Trade of the Atlantic
- “Engine” that would propel Europe towards the Industrial Revolution?
- Created “great wealth for few, great misery for many”

“Refinement of Cruelty”
- Olaudah Equiano’s chronicles
- Descriptions of the loading of slaves and “The Middle Passage”
	- Thomas Phillips in 1694—captain of the Hannibal
		- Africans “as much as the works of God’s hands”
		- Yet, fully embraced a paternalistic, colonial rationale

Estimate of Numbers
- From 1500 to 1870, roughly 12 million African slaves made it alive to the Americas
- Africa’s population attrition should easily exceed 25 million

Long-term Impact of the Slave Trade on Africa
- Geopolitical Power Shifts
	- General destabilization and depopulation of the region
		- King Afonso’s plea to Portuguese Crown 1526
	- Power shifts from inland Sub-Saharan kingdoms to tropical coast states
		- Brutal, aggressive native regimes driven by greed to meet demand for slaves
- Effect on Economic Productivity
	- Depletion of young men of reproductive age in West Africa
	- Productive human resources exchanged for non-productive luxury items
	- Lasting impact on Africa’s inability to catch up to the industrial world?
- Explanations for the Rise of the West
