Key Focus of Lecture:  
1) Motives behind the European push for exploration  
2) Why slow and incremental development of this process?  
I) The Appetite for Spice  
a) Major Maritime Breakthroughs in late 15th century

(2) Major 15th century crisis—search for new sea-route to satisfy pepper craving  
II) Cape by Treacherous Cape  
a) Why did the “search” for a sea-route take so long?  
i) What’s so hard about sailing down W. Africa, hugging the coast all the way?  
b) John Thornton’s Analysis  
i) “Short-range, unromantic, step-by step exploration was the principal method of  
European expansion”  
(1) Lack of financial resources to fund ambitious transoceanic ventures  
ii) Slow, gradual understanding of patterns of prevailing winds and currents  
(1) Westerlies vs. N.E. Trade winds  
(2) Had to accept point of no return—Cape Bojador, just south of Canary Islands  
(3) But could Africans have sailed across the Atlantic to the Caribbean?  
iii) “Volta do Mar” or “return through the sea”

(1) Adoption of the maritime compass—a Chinese technology brought to Europe in  
12th century by Arab merchants  
c) “African Wing” of Exploration 1340-1470  
i) Step-by-step process, searching for opportunities to trade or raid  
ii) With every windfall, finance the next expedition  
iii) Island-hopping  
(1) Tacking all the way back north—“on a close reach”—they discovered  
(a) 1300s Azores  
(b) By 1350s, Madeiras, Canary Islands (“rediscovered” by Malocello)  
(c) By 1400 Cape Verde Islands  
d) The Canary Islands—Colonial Blueprint for the Americas  
i) Indigenous Population—Guanche  
(1) As of 1400, roughly 80,000 to 100,000 people in this group of islands  
(2) Light-skinned people, perhaps related to Berbers of North Africa

(b) Who did it benefit?  
ii) By the 1400s, Castilian Spain had gained jurisdiction over the islands  
(1) Ferdinand and Isabella solidified Castilian authority on the island
