Key Focus of Lecture:  
1) Motives behind the European push for exploration  
2) Why slow and incremental development of this process?  

## The Appetite for Spice  
Major Maritime Breakthroughs in late 15th century  
- 1488—Portuguese pilot Bartholomew Dias rounds the Cape of Good Hope  
- 1492 Columbus receives commission to sail across Atlantic  
- 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas  
- 1498 Vasco da Gama reaches Calicut, India after a grueling 10-month journey

What incentives had led to these breakthroughs?  
- Extend Christendom to outflank the spread of Islam  
	- Allure of the Prester John Myth
		- The "allure" of Prester John, a mythical Christian king, ==stemmed from a combination of factors==. His kingdom was described as a land of fabulous wealth and wonders, and he was portrayed as a powerful ally in the Crusades and against infidels (Indians), sparking European curiosity and desire for exploration. The legend also reflected a yearning for a virtuous, unifying monarch in a politically unstable Europe.
	- Vasco da Gama landed in Calicut hoping to find “Christians and spices”  
- Search for natural resources, esp. land to cultivate cash crops  
- Most importantly, trade incentives  
	- Alternative trade route to Asia, esp. more reliable access to spices  

The Demand for Pepper and other Spices  
- Conspicuous consumption and social class  
	- By 12th century, spices like ground pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon markers of wealth  
		- E.g. Ritual of displaying the “spice platter” during meals  
		- Spices given as coveted gifts like precious jewels  
	- In fact, spices became the ultimate “status symbols”  
		- The spicier the dish, the more respect the host garnered  
- Medieval Europe’s dependence on Asian imports  
	- Luxury items associated with “paradise,” with mythic Shangri-La  
	- Asian trade was the engine that drove the global economy  
- Rise of the nouveau-riche middle-class in late 14th century
	- By the late 1300s, price of ground pepper had risen 30-fold
	- Major 15th century crisis—search for new sea-route to satisfy pepper craving  

## Cape by Treacherous Cape  
Why did the “search” for a sea-route take so long?
- What’s so hard about sailing down W. Africa, hugging the coast all the way?  
- Sailing down was easy, but trying to sail back upwards, the winds would blow you outwards

John Thornton’s Analysis  
- “Short-range, unromantic, step-by step exploration was the principal method of European expansion”  
	- Lack of financial resources to fund ambitious transoceanic ventures  
- Slow, gradual understanding of patterns of prevailing winds and currents  
	- Westerlies vs. N.E. Trade winds  
	- But could Africans have sailed across the Atlantic to the Caribbean?  
- “Volta do Mar” or “return through the sea”
- Adoption of the maritime compass—a Chinese technology brought to Europe in 12th century by Arab merchants  

“African Wing” of Exploration 1340-1470  
- Step-by-step process, searching for opportunities to trade or raid  
- With every windfall, finance the next expedition  
- Island-hopping
	- Tacking all the way back north—“on a close reach”—they discovered  
		- 1300s Azores  
		- By 1350s, Madeiras, Canary Islands (“rediscovered” by Malocello)  
		- By 1400 Cape Verde Islands  
	- The Canary Islands—Colonial Blueprint for the Americas  
		- Indigenous Population—Guanche  
			- As of 1400, roughly 80,000 to 100,000 people in this group of islands 
			- Light-skinned people, perhaps related to Berbers of North Africa  
			- Neolithic hunter-gatherers, with little immunity to European diseases 
				- Pierre Chaunu’s idea of “disenclavement”  
				- Who did it benefit?  
		- By the 1400s, Castilian Spain had gained jurisdiction over the islands  
			- Ferdinand and Isabella solidified Castilian authority on the island  
			- Provided experience for subduing the Americas?
