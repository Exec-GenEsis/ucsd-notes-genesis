Key Focus This Week:  
1) How three empires under Muslim rulers emerged, thrived, and fell into decline  
2) How they managed large communities of non-Muslim subjects in their realm  
3) To what degree did they succeed or fail in addressing challenges of religious pluralism?  
## Dar Al-Islam “The Abode of Islam”  
The Link Between Various Islamic Networks in 13th-14th century  
- Mostly integrated by three emerging Islamic Empires by 1500s  
	- Mughals in India, Safavids in Persia, Ottomans in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Balkans  

## The Rise of Ottomans  
Humble Beginnings  
- Small Turkic tribe ostensibly subservient to the Seljuks of Rum  
- (Person) Osman Bey effectively exploited the rivalry between the Byzantines and Seljuks
	- Martial, Militaristic structure adopted within this timeframe
- By the late 13th century, both major powers had been weakened

Ottoman Expansion  
- By 1300s, conquered Asia Minor and the Balkans (Serbia, Albania, Bulgaria)  
	- Constantinople finally fell to Mehmet II in 1453  
- Greatest expansion in 1500s under Suleiman the Magnificent  

## Ottoman Imperial System  
Establishing a Centralized Bureaucracy  
- Traditional system of tribal alliances proved inadequate  
- Impose a clear-cut military structure to every aspect of government  

Sultan’s Civil Service—The Ghulam System  
- Devshirme—provincial slave levy dating to 1395 to supply “ghulams”
	- "Class of servant" might be more appropriate?
- Why Christian “slaves” instead of Muslim freemen?  
- Trained as administrators and soldiers—the Janissary Corps  
	- Inner Service  
		- Highest post of Grand Vizier appointed from the Janissary Corps  
	- Outer Service  
	- Janissary ideal at its best  
- Janissaries’ new elite status  
	- Evolved into the preeminent political and military elite in the Ottoman empire  
	- Over time, privileged status can also breed nepotism and corruption
		- Absentee officials buying titles of "Janissary" inflated numbers.
		- By late 17th century, Janissary corps had grown from 7000 to 20,000 members  
		- Loss of discipline in the rank and file of the corps  

Provincial Administration—The Timar System  
- Timars—administrative and tax-collecting grants dispensed by the Sultan  
- Organized according to military structure  
	- Direct correspondence between rank, revenue, and military responsibility  
	- All timariots must dutifully collect taxes  
		- Third party oversight by qadis to assure fairness and accountability
- Inheritance of timar grants  
	- Theoretically grant to be returned to the Sultan when a timariot dies  
	- Eventually system also became susceptible to abuse  

Ethnic and Religious Communities—The Millet System  
- At first, religious or ethnic affiliation not a prerequisite for timar grants  
	- Local elites, Christian and Jewish, allowed to administer their own communities or millah (“nation” in Arabic)  
- Religious Tolerance  
	- Level of religious tolerance in stark contrast to that in European Christendom  
	- Overall, Ottoman rule was very accommodating to its dhimmi subjects  
	- Yet, with decline, also came greater intolerance  
		- Division of (Askeri) ruling class and Reaya (ruled class) along religious lines  
		- By 18th century, greater discrimination against non-Muslim subjects  

Systemic Crisis Argument  
- End of expansion also meant exposing the structural fault-lines in the system  
	- Relied heavily on the military aristocracy:  
	- Central state kept them in check by provisional measures  
	- All short-term solutions that ironically contributed to long-term cancer
