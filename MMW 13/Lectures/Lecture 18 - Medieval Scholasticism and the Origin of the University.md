Key Focus of lecture:  
1) Changing social landscape in late medieval Europe  
2) Trace the intellectual development of this period—from universities to the Medieval Synthesis (Scholasticism)  
## Economic and Social Shifts in Late Medieval Europe  

Economic Landscape Prior to the 12th Century  
- Feudal life had been pervasive—very few towns  

Rise of Towns and Guilds  
- By the 13th and 14th century urban expansion dramatically altered social conditions 
	- “Town air brings more freedom”  
- Gradual demographic shift from countryside to cities and towns  

Rise of National Principalities  
- Over time, more and more German princes turned to urban centers for support  
- Undermined the traditional role of the Church as “the channel of grace”  
	- Increasing competition between ecclesiastical and secular courts
		- E.g. Marriage
- Need for municipal bureaucracies
	- With ever increasing complexity of secular affairs in towns and cities  
	- Charters for educational guilds to train administrators
		- Main reason behind educational charters

## The Advent of the “University”
Term originally referred to a “union” or collective of students
- Union for collective bargaining power against landlord rent hikers, as well as need for better lecturers
	- Qualifications: Older than 21, studied for 6 years, promises to teach for longer than 2 years, must not be "smirched by infamy"
- 1215 Univ. of Paris statutes against imposters and unqualified lecturers  
	- Qualifications for lecturing in the humanities  
- These various groups then became consolidated as the “University”  
	- By 1500, almost 50 universities across Europe  

Platonic vs. Real Life of a College Student circa 1500  
- "College Life: Correspondences between Students and their Fathers”  

The Ivory-tower of Liberal Studies?  
- Vergerius (1370-1444): Renaissance teacher writing to one of his students  
	- University education is a privilege not suited for all - not for "hordes" ill equipped intellectually. - Wake up sheeple
		- “Let the boy of limited capacity work only at that subject in which he shows he can attain some result” (Trade) 
			- Such as Medicine and Law?
	- Liberal studies or the humanities—only for the gifted!  
		- i.e. History, Moral Philosophy, and Rhetoric  
- Most undergraduate G.E. curriculum still reflects goals of his “liberal studies”  

The “liberal” in “Liberal Studies” actually means “liberating”  
- “We cannot fully understand one subject unless we can perceive its relationship to  the rest”  
	- Stanford’s rationale for inaugurating a new “Humanities Core”  
		- “Science and technology cannot tell us what is fair and just, what is beautiful, or what it means to be free. Nor can they answer the most profound questions that every human being faces: How am I to choose? What gives my life meaning? While medicine can explain the processes of death, no biologist has yet found a gene for life’s significance. Literature, philosophy, classics, the arts, religious studies and history are springboards for exploring answers to all of these topics. The humanities thus provide a foundation that graduates return to time and time again throughout their careers and lives.”  
- True life-long learning is only possible through a quest that begins early  
	- An inquisitive mind must be cultivated in youth while mind is still supple  
	- Secret to true freedom and a fuller life  
	- A humanities education is about the long term, not the short term  
		- i.e. How will you live your life when you will actually have money and time on your hands?  
		- “The Offer” of Bowdoin College (founded 1794) to all its students:  
~~~“To be at home in all lands and all ages;  
To count Nature a familiar acquaintance,  
And Art an intimate friend;  
To gain a standard for the appreciation of others’ work  
And the criticism of your own;  
To carry the keys of the world’s library in your pocket,  
And feel its resources behind you in whatever task you undertake;  
To make hosts of friends . . .  
Who are to be leaders in all walks of life;  
To lose yourself in generous enthusiasms  
And cooperate with others for common ends—  
This is the offer of the college for the best four years of your life.”  
William DeWitt Hyde 1906~~~
