Key Focus:
1)     Conflict between the missionary impulse and the economic incentive behind the Spanish colonial experience in the Americas
2)     Cultural and social repercussions of both goals

## Global Christendom or Silver Bullion?
Religious Conversion vs. Economic Exploitation
- Fundamental tension that defined 300 years of Spanish colonial rule in the Americas
- Missionary goals were to spread Christianity to potential natives, clashing with economic exploitation blueprint of Spain

Missionary Rationale for Conversion
- 1st Rationale: Native American peoples had “souls”
	- Valladodid Debate 1550—De Las Casas vs. Juan Sepuldeva
		- De Las Casas argued that the Native Americans had souls, countering Juan's claim for them being "Natural Slaves"
	- American “noble savages” vs. view of Africans per Aristotelian racist theories
	- Convenient racial stigma and double standard placed on Africans?
- 2nd Rationale: Duty to protect native Americans as subjects of the king
	- Idea of "Integration" into Spanish systems using "**reducciones**"—resettlement programs to gather scattered communities into controllable towns.

Champion of Missionary Cause: De Las Casas (1474-1566)
- Personal background
	- Inspired by moral arguments of Fray Antonio de Montesinos
	- Joined the Dominican Order after witnessing abuse in Carribeans
	- His 1542 Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies - Exposed Spanish brutality...
- Basis of what would become “The Black Legend”
	- De Las Casas’s graphic accounts of Spanish atrocities in the Caribbean
- Altruism or self-serving agenda behind the missionary rationale?
	- Missionaries often exaggerated native eagerness to embrace the gospel
		- Yet “The [_conquistadores_] have taken no more care to have the Faith of Jesus Christ preached to those nations than they would to have it preached to dogs or other beasts.”
		- Resulted often in half-hearted or perfunctory conversion
	- De Las Casas’s Appeal to the Spanish Crown, King Philip II - Was this Using Christianity to save souls or using converts to save the Catholic Church?

Conquistador Rationale for Economic Exploitation
- _Encomiendas_: “provisional trusteeships” given by the Crown to conquistadors
	- To assume essential administrative duties like labor and protection
	- _Encomenderos_ expected to safeguard the life and property of their native subjects but ended up abusing and extracting resources
- Missionaries appealed to the Crown to abolish encomiendas

The Crown’s compromise—a middle course
- Keep the encomiendas intact, but subject them to official regulation
	- Law of Burgos in 1512
	- System of Audiencias—royal judicial oversight over encomienda system
	- New Law of 1542 as response to changing developments

## Silver and the Mercantilist Logic
Windfall of Silver
- Silver mines in Zacatecas (northern Mexico) and Potosi (modern-day Bolivia)
- American silver had “lubricated the world economy” (Bentley)
- Geopolitical advantages for Spanish Crown
- Mercantilist Assumptions
	- Pursue protectionism as opposed to free trade

Spanish Implementation of Mercantilism
- Royal Monopoly over Silver production
	- Crown receiving 20% of all silver—the “Quinto”
	- In addition, monopoly over mercury
		- Mercury mines in Huancavelica
- Monopoly over transport—The Flota System
	- Covered 85% of all Atlantic trade in 16th century
- Exploitation of conscript labor—Repartimiento
	- Based on the old Inca Mita system of labor conscription
- Demographic consequences

Missionaries’ Reaction
- Provide refuge for native people from the Repartimiento system
- Crown’s reaction was to revoke the charters of many local missions
- Coincided with persecution of some missionaries for heresy
	- Destruction of murals and native iconic art
	- Forbid syncretism of Christianity and local religious symbols
