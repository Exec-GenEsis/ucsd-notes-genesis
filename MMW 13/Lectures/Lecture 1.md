Outline Lecture One—Introduction Lecture to Course Themes  
Focus of lecture:  
1) The origin and impact of the “Rise of the West” mythology  
2) Towards a more inclusive, polycentric narrative of “world history”?  
I) “Rise of the West” Master Narrative  
a) The Myth of European Exceptionalism  
i) Eurocentric “world historians” assumed that Western culture inherently unique,  
intrinsically exceptional  
(1) Distinguished by change, innovation, rationality, entrepreneurship  
ii) Posited a binary opposition of paralysis vs. dynamism between East and West  
(1) Conceded that prior to 15th century, medieval Europe too had been steeped in  
religious fatalism—seeing this world as “vale of tears”  
(2) But that from the 15th century on, Europe began to shed this ideology of  
renunciation for a belief in the infinite potential of human agency  
(a) Insisting that “only in the West” does one find a spirit of...  
iii) Yet begs the question: Was the rest of the world EVER mired in the same type of  
religious dogmatism that had paralyzed medieval Europe?  
b) Sources of this Myth of European Exceptionalism  
i) 19th century European historians attributing the largely uncontested global supremacy  
of European imperialism to some “inherent historical necessity”  
ii) Denial of “Coevalness”  
(1) Assumption that historical change does not factor into other cultures’ past  
iii) Diffusionist Theory—West “pulled” other cultures out of their static past  
c) How Historical Perspective Impacts the Future  
i) If we take a more objective and inclusive view of what the world was like before  
European colonial hegemony  
ii) If we “begin the story early enough” as Janet Abu-Lughod puts it, it makes all the  
difference  
II) Explanations for “The Rise of the West”  
a) David Buck’s “Was it Pluck or Luck that Made the West Grow Rich?”  
i) “Pluck” as in the instinct, knack, or propensity inherent in European culture that  
propelled the West to economic prominence by the 18th century  
ii) “Luck” as in unanticipated, non-premeditated global contingencies, accidents,  
serendipity that allowed the West to stumble upon its good fortune  
b) David Landes’s “European Exceptionalism” argument  
i) “Rise of the West” due to Europe’s unique cultural heritage  
ii) Europe had all the characteristics of an “inventive” civilization  
(1) Risk-taking, entrepreneurial spirit, worldly rationality  
c) Andre Gunder Frank “Historical Discontinuity” argument  
i) Europe’s success represents an anomaly in its political and economic evolution  
ii) More a “discontinuity” than a pre-ordained “inevitability”  
d) R. Bin Wong’s “Separate Trajectories” argument  
i) No shared or universal “meta-narrative” for what “progress” means

(1) Important to “go beyond asking European-derived questions,” such as “Why did  
China fail where Europe succeeded?”  
ii) Contingency, Accident, Conjuncture  
(1) Contingency: Every new phenomenon is conditioned by earlier developments  
(2) Accidents: Unpredictable events beyond short term human control  
(3) Conjuncture: Independent local developments collide or intersect to shape the  
course of history
