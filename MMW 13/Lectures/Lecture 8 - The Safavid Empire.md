##  The Safavid Rise to Power in Persia  
Isma’il and the Messianic Ideology of the Qizilbash  
- In 1501, captured key city of Tabriz in northwestern Iran and founded a new dynasty  
- How did the 14-year-old Isma’il achieve this?  
	- Exploited every possible source of messianic ideology in Islam  
		- From the Shi’a tradition, beliefs of a sect known as the Twelvers  
			- Inclusion of divinity in his title as the “God-shah”  
			- Blasphemous claim
		- From the Sufi tradition, belief in transmission of mystical powers  
			- Qizilbash warriors claimed Isma’il as descendant of a 13th century Sufi leader—Safi al-Din  
	- Religious zealotry and divine purpose infused into the Safavid cause  
- Qizilbash fanaticism
	- Inspired terror due to their fanaticism and blood oath sworn to Isma’il
		- Participating in cannibalism to show loyalty to Isma'il
		- Even riding into battle unarmored.
	- Proved anathema to the Sunni conservatism of the Ottomans  

The Safavid-Ottoman Conflict  
- Clash of Heterodoxy vs. Orthodoxy  
	- Safavids intent on spreading their Sufi/Shi’ite ideology  
	- Ottomans equally intent on projecting themselves as defender of “true” Islam
	- Ottoman Sultan Selim the Grim's letter to Isma'li
	- Issued a fatwa on Isma'li's head
- Battle of Chaldiran (Kaldi-ran) 1514
	- Janissaries equipped with French weaponry (muskets, cannons) made a sound win for Ottoman empire
	- Safavids routed but not destroyed. Isma'li &/co move into Persian heartlands.
- Geopolitical consequences  
	- Ottoman-Safavid conflict lasted throughout the 16th to 18th centuries  
	- The interruption of the Mediterranean-Middle Eastern commercial network

## Safavid Consolidation under Shah Abbas I (r.1588-1629)  
Securing the Empire—Isfahan phase in 1590 under Shah Abbas

Pragmatic ruler “both feared and loved”  
- Ruler in the Machiavellian vein? (“The Prince” written in late 1400s)
	- Pragmatist not ideologue or religious zealot  
	- Skillfully manipulated his public image as “Shah of the People”  
		- Made sure his authority and persona were both highly visible  
		- Well versed in discourse around religions
	- “More feared than loved”?  
		- Went to markets, conversed and talked to the people
		- His palace constructed with wide verandas and courtyards, meaning anyone could see the Shah in his palace.
		- Played no favorites, tolerated no sycophants
		- Effectively built a myth around himself
		- More unassuming and familliar he appeared, the more people trembled
	- Religious Policies
		- Father Simon: No one knew for sure what faith Shah Abbas espoused
		- Favored none and influenced by none
		- Effectively purged the Qizilbash and whatever residual influence it had  
		- After Shah Abbas, dominance of conservative Shi’a imams at expense of other sects
