Mongol expansionist policy circa. late 13th Century
- Khubilai Khan’s unsuccessful attempt to control southeast Asia  
- The ill-fated naval invasion of Japan in 1281

	- Lengthy expeditions north and south  
	- Assertion of maritime power in Southeast Asia and Indian Ocean

The Purpose of the Treasure Fleets (1402-1435)  
- Extend Chinese maritime presence  
	- Military: Suppressing piracy for the sake of securing trade routes  
		- “To cleanse and pacify the sea routes”  
	- Cultural: Extending cultural embassies to demonstrate imperial prestige  
		- “Unifying the seas and continents” beyond even Han and Tang  
	- Commercial: Aside from revenue, demonstrate largesse and wealth  
	- Political: Powerbroker and “kingmaker” in regional politics  
		- Overall, 47 new tributary states were added as the result of the expeditions  
		- Paternalistic logic of tributary system  
	- “Transforming power of imperial virtue (and magnanimity)”  
- Ming fleet’s “carrot and stick” approach  
	- Dazzle with its wealth and size, intimidate with massive firepower  
	- Profound geopolitical impact throughout southeast Asia and Indian ocean
