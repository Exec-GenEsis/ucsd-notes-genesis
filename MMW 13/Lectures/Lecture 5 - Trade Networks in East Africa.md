Key Focus:  
1) What role did the Swahili coast play in the Indian Ocean network?  
2) What were the features of this littoral culture prior to the Portuguese intrusion?  
3) How did the littoral features of this culture shape its worldview?  

## Myth of the “Dark Continent”  
a) View of Africa through the Prism of European Colonialism  
i) Shaped by 19th century European imperialist imagination  
ii) Eurocentric perception of a continent empty of civilization and history  
(1) Birthplace of human biological evolution, but disregard for historical evolution  
(2) e.g. Trimingham: “By adopting Islam, Africa entered into history”  
iii) Need to recognize Africa’s integral role in the global network of commercial,  
religious, and cultural exchange before European colonialism  

## The Legacy of Swahili Civilization  
a) “Swahili” as a Geographic Location  
i) Reference to coastal region of East Africa spanning over 1200 miles  
ii) By the 13th century, this “Swahili” region included roughly 40 trading towns  
iii) Mogadishu in the north, Sofala in the south, and Malindi, Mombasa, Zanzibar, and  
Kilwa in between  
b) “Kiswahili” as a Cultural Designation  
i) Language that the people in this region generally spoke  
(1) Primarily dialects of the Bantu tongue  
ii) Ubiquitous presence of Islam due to both immigration and conversion  
(1) Indigenization of Islam vs. “Pure” Islam?  
(a) Ibn-Battuta’s impressive account of Mogadishu in 1332  
c) “Swahili” as a Demographic Distinction  
i) In general, hybrid of African, Arab, Persian, and Gujarati ethnicities  
(1) Quite meaningless to distinguish “foreign” from “local,” “immigrant” from  
“native” or “us” from “them”  
ii) The Swahili coast was regarded less as a boundary but more as a gateway  
(1) Eclectic, permeable, “macrocosmic” rather than a homogenous, insular  
“microcosmic” world  
(2) Part of an “international trading world,” not a political world  
d) Meaning of “littoral”  
i) Literally, “of the coast, shore, or banks”  
(1) Figuratively, “littoral” describes a culture that is ever elastic, ever porous, never  
bounded, never insulated  
(2) J.C. Heesterman aptly summed up: “The littoral forms a frontier zone that is not  
there to separate or enclose, but which rather finds its meaning in its  
permeability”  
ii) “Littoral” vs. “parochial” consciousness—which applies to us today?  

## The Permeability of a Littoral Culture
a) Polycentric network of Swahili Cities  
i) System of reciprocity, of a “niche trade,” rather than hegemony  
(1) E.g. Prominence of Mogadishu and Somali cities in the 12th century  
(2) Later prominence of Kilwa and southern cities in the 13th century  
(3) Kilwa southernmost point to which ocean-faring merchant ships could travel if  
they wanted to sail home the same year  
b) The Rhythm of the Winds  
i) N.E. Monsoons (Kas Kazi in Swahili)  
ii) S.W. Monsoons (Kusi in Swahili)  
iii) Practical implications for trade network  
(1) Instead of one people or one city monopolizing trade, each party filled a niche in  
this highly dynamic, polycentric, and elastic system
