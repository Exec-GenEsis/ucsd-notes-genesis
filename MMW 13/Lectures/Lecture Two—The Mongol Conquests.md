Focus of lecture:  
1) Contingent factors behind the short-lived but consequential Mongol empire  
2) Global consequences and legacy of this phenomenon  

## I) Age of the Nomad  

Extent of Mongol Empire  
- Area conquered in three short generations starting from 1206  
- All without modern communications, transport, or weapons—How?  

Military Advantages  
- Warrior-based society
	- Men under 60 were expected to fight
	- No salary, but split of spoils
	- Use of Tribal "Retirement Fund" to provide for over 60
- Fighting skills and strategies  
	- Skilled riders with effective use of the short composite bow and the nerge
		- Focus on light armor, horseback, and long range, hit-and-run strategies
	- No shame in retreat—in fact, used it as a battle strategy
		- Bait and encirclement
	- Use of hunting tactics like the nerge to encircle the enemy  
		- Nerge - encirclement, surrounding the enemy, hunting roots
	- Use of banners and drums to coordinate rapid movement
		- Resulted in smaller than actuality armies
	- Effective use of siege-craft
		- Did not invent them, but recruited best engineers for innovation
	- Terror as a strategy of warfare
		- Committing atrocities to resistant cities, leaving survivors to tell the tale
			- *Aura Farming?*

Climate Change and Patterns of Nomadic Behavior Prior to 1200
- David Ringrose’s on effects of climate change (Expansion and Global Interactions)
	- Significant warming trend from 800-1200 C.E.
		- Demographic effects on a global scale
			- Due to warmer climate = more agricultural spots = more farmers
		- “Buffer zone” between nomads and farmers shrank significantly as a result
			- Resulted in more tensions between the cultures
- Nomad Incursions from 11th to 12th century  
	- As such, by early 1200s, Genghis Khan perhaps simply integrating what other nomad regimes had already set up?  
## II) “The Accidental Empire”  
Conquerors by default  
- Mongol expansion under Genghis Khan not by design but by default  
- Their intent always to follow the traditional “outer frontier strategy”  

Problem with “Outer Frontier Strategy” for the Mongols  
- But late 1100s, Mongols had to face semi-nomadic rulers who now occupied the fertile regions  
	- Jurchens had established the Jin (Chin) Dynasty in northern China  
		- Had their own formidable cavalry to match the Mongols  
			- War of attrition ended up destroying basis of productivity in northern China  
			- In western Asia, faced defiance of Turkic nomad rulers, such as Khwarazm Shah 
				- Resulted in all-out punitive expedition by Genghis khan in 1219

Motive Behind Mongol Expansion  
- Punitive retaliation without restraint  
- Ignored the simple equation: When you destroy something completely, you leave nothing from which to extract concessions and wealth 

Reluctant administrators of land they conquered by default  
- Initially saw peasants as dispensable and farmland as an eyesore
- E.g. Ogodei Khan’s initial plan was to turn all of northern China into pasture  
## III) The Impact of the Mongol Empire  
Religious Pluralism  
- Integrated empire facilitated the spread of religious systems  
	- Religion had the means to transcend ethnic and cultural barriers  
	- E.g. presence of William of Rubruck and later of the Polos in Mongol court  

Economic Coherence  
- Provided secure and efficient infrastructure for trade  
	- Insurance against the aggression of other nomads against caravans  
	- Tendency for nomadic rulers to favor commerce  
- Mongol measures to facilitate trade  
- 1250-1350: A truly global network
