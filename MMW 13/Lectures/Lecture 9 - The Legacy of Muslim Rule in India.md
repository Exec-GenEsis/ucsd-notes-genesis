Main Focus:  
1) Muslim strategies for ruling the indigenous Hindu majority  
2) Akbar’s experiment with religious syncretism  

## The Initial Encounter  

Muslim nomads entered the Punjab in northern India as early as the 8th century  
- Plundered northern India for wealth but did not stay to govern  

Origin of the term “Hindu”?  
- Mutual Prejudice  
	- Hindu aloofness—regarded outsiders as inherently "impious and impure"
	- Muslim-Prejudice—Regarded Hindus as “incorrigible idol-worshippers”  
## The Delhi Sultanate (1205-1526)  
First Muslim rulers to establish a permanent foundation in northern India 
- *Choice to settle in order to better tap into lower resources*
- Reign of Alauddin Khalji (1296-1316)  
	- Policy of oppressing Hindu subjects through heavy taxation  
		- Tax them so much that “no Hindu could hold up his head”  
		- Exact tax payments using terror and harassment  
		- Relying on qadis (kazis) to sanction tax burden on Hindus  
	- Zia ud-din Barni: “the sultan had no acquaintance with learning...thus very few learned men visited him.”  
	- Sultan Alauddin’s approach more rule than exception

Ibn-Battuta ’s account of the Delhi Sultanate’s repressive policy  
- Born Abu Abdullah Muhammed Ibn-Battuta in Tangiers, Morocco (1304 C.E.)
- Trained as an Islamic Scholar and occasionally served as qadi
- Extent of his travels
	- Arrived in Delhi in 1333
	- Provided account of one sultan’s forced relocation of all Hindus from Delhi to Dawlat Abad because of a found missive insulting him
		- One legged man had difficulty leaving
			- Thrown from the tower "How dare you defy my order"
		- Blind man going in circles
			- Forced to be dragged behind a horse across land
			- Only the foot made it
Wealth amassed by the Delhi Sultanate
- Admiration for the minarets and mosques in Delhi  
- Awe at the wealth and generosity of the sultan
- But how was this wealth amassed?
	- Taxes, heavy heavy taxes. Wealth from the working class
- Bitter legacy of Muslim rule in India under the Delhi Sultanate tragically reverberates to this day.

Why Islam would remain a minority religion in India
- Animosity from minority Muslim rulers and majority Hindu subjects got worse with each ruler and each increased tax.
## Akbar’s Syncretic Experiment and Religious Pluralism
Height of the Mughal empire  
- Grandson of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire  
- Reigned from 1556-1605 
- Akbar’s Inclusive Method of Governing  
	- His own Grand Vizier was a Hindu named Birbal
		- Closest childhood friend and confidant
	- 1/3rd of bureaucracy was Hindu officials
	- Removed Jizya tax on Hindus

Promotion of the “Divine Faith” or Din-i-Ilahi  
- Merged the ethical foundations of Islam, Hinduism, and Zoroastrianism  
- Reinforced emperor devotion as the embodiment of all these traditions  
- Similar to Shah Abbas in his theological curiosity  
- Frequently discussed theology with teachers of all faiths
	- E.g. painting depicting him conversing with Jesuit missionaries

Reversion to repression  
- Aurangzeb, his great grandson (1659-1707)  
- Failure of Mughals to win trust and loyalty of their Hindu subjects contributed to their subsequent decline
