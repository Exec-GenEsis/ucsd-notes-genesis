Key Questions:
1)     How did the Christian and Islamic worlds respond differently to the onslaught of the Black Death?
2)     What lasting social, economic, and cultural repercussions did the Black Death have on late medieval Europe?

## The Magnitude of the Black Death
Ripe Preconditions
- Demographic changes
	- Warming trend from 800 to 1200—population density
	- The Great Famine 1315-1322 in northern Europe
- From local epidemics to global pandemic
	- Greater proximity between human settlements and wilderness
		- In 1300s, transmitted by fleas first to rats, then to humans
	- Interlocking trade networks—yet another side-effect of globalization

How the Plague Spread in Europe 1347-1350
- Invariably followed the contours of the trade routes
- Death toll of the Plague
## Responses to the Plague
In Europe
- Boccaccio’s Decameron
	- Preemptive measures
	- Plenty of warning, but utter sense of futility
- Range of psychological responses
	- Ascetic approach vs. hedonistic approach
	- Most practiced moderate forms of protection
	- Boccaccio: “general lack of regard citizens and relations showed to each other”
	- Desperate flight from cities
- Ideas of original sin and innate depravity
	- Plague understood as God’s punishment
		- Flagellants and scapegoating
	- Apocalyptic Vision
		 - General escalation of hysteria, persecution, and violence

In Islamic Regions—esp. Sunni Mamluk territory
- Emphasis on maintenance of community
- Plague as a “collective social calamity”—encouraged focus on community
	- Continuation of all civic and religious activities
- Overall, Muslim response was one of “reverent resignation”
	- More “pacific, collective, and controlled”
	- Orthodox Muslims did not entertain a vision of the apocalypse
- Detractors like Ibn-al Khatib in Granada

## The Plague as “Watershed in Medieval History”
“Reverent resignation” vs. Individual agency
- Community vs. each for oneself
- Status quo vs. whatever radical means possible
 - In Europe, more desperate and audacious attempt to change one’s own destiny

Social Impact of Depopulation
- Bargaining Power of Peasantry
	- Peasants’ lot improved vis-à-vis nobility
	- Shift to skilled labor jobs in cities that paid more

Economic Impact of New Trend in Consumption
- Higher demand for manufactured goods and luxury imports after the Plague
	- Harry Miskimin’s “The Economy of Early Renaissance Europe 1300-1460”
		- Increase in purchasing power of survivors
		- Additional resources for consumption and investment
- Spurred higher demand for manufactured luxury goods
	- Royal ordinances to relax restrictions for entering guilds
	- Shortage of skilled labor also led to higher wages

Implications of Demographic Changes for Europe’s Renaissance
- Economic boost to the manufacturing sector and commerce in luxury items
- Extra capital for patrons of culture and investors in exploration and industry
- Rebirth of Europe “forged in the crucible of its terrible yet transcendent ordeal with the Black Death”
