Key Questions:  
1) What geopolitical conditions allowed the Portuguese to become a key player in the Indian Ocean network?  
2) How did they maintain their tenuous hold in the 16th century? Why did they fail?  

## Contingent Global Factors Behind Portuguese Expansion  

Power vacuum in the Indian Ocean Network in 1498  
- No dominant power in the polycentric region  
- 1435 last Ming expedition  

Chinese vs. Portuguese “Networks”  
- Chinese fleets under Zheng He were not “empire-builders”  
- Unlike Portugal, an expansionist, proselytizing, and upstart power  

The Lure of Africa  
- The gold trade along the West African coastline  
- Raiding and trading provided revenue to bankroll further expeditions  
- Potential for pepper cultivation in sub-Saharan Africa

Ottoman Hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean  
- Attempt to circumvent the Ottoman blockade by going around Africa
- Safavid-Ottoman conflict also proved detrimental to integrity of trade routes

## Rogue Intervention at the “Crossroads of the World”—the Indian Ocean  

But Why Portugal?  
- Relatively poor state, with a largely agricultural and fishing economy  
- Could not muster more than 2 dozen warships in any region
- Pivotal role of Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460)  

Vasco da Gama in 1498  
- First direct European contact with the Indian Ocean network—ominous beginnings  
- Created an atmosphere of mutual animosity and suspicion  

Portuguese Ambition of a Trade Monopoly in early 16th century  
- New generation of “colonial-soldier-administrators” like Don Francisco D’Almeida  
- Analyzed the structure of the trade network and aimed to monopolize it  
- Controlling the “chokepoints” or key transfer points of this network  
	- Kilwa—Southern terminus of Swahili-Indian Ocean link  
		- Intersection of faith and pillaging—seeking divine sanction?  
	- Mombasa—key trade link between southern Africa and India  
		- Encountered more resistance, yet burned and pillaged  
		- Sultan of Mombasa’s letter to Malindi to describe the pillaging  
	- Port of Hormuz (1508)—narrow strait into Persian Gulf
	- Malacca (Malaka) (1511)  
	- Macao and Nagasaki  
		- Don Afonse d’Alboquerque—main architect of this aggressive policy  
			- “Safe transit passes” for all entering and leaving “chokepoints”  

Most significant was establishment of Estado do India (State of India) in 1510  
- Portugal’s second capital at the Indian city of Goa  
- Hallmarks of Portuguese Rule  
	- Religious Intolerance
	- Ruthless Intimidation  
		- Gaspar Correa’s account of da Gama’s brutality  
		- How best to explain this extreme behavior?  

## Demise of Portugal’s Quixotic Quest  

Acts of a desperate, aggressive, peripheral power chasing a grand ambition  
- “Chihuahua complex”  
- Shock was key reason why region was unprepared for the Portuguese  

Yet, Portugal could not sustain this hegemony for long  
- By end of 16th century, its hold in the Indian Ocean was tenuous at best  
	- Conflicting interests at home  
	- Private Portuguese contraband trade that circumvented the Crown  
- Resurgence of Islamic Power  
	- 1622 Safavids under Shah Abbas recaptured Hormuz  
	- 1698 Sultan of Oman captured the Swahili coastal cities
