Focus of lecture:  
1) The origin and impact of the “Rise of the West” mythology  
2) Towards a more inclusive, polycentric narrative of “world history”?  
## “Rise of the West” Master Narrative  
The Myth of European Exceptionalism  
- Eurocentric “world historians” assumed that Western culture inherently unique, intrinsically exceptional  
	- Distinguished by change, innovation, rationality, entrepreneurship  
- Posited a binary opposition of paralysis vs. dynamism between East and West  
	- Conceded that prior to 15th century, medieval Europe too had been steeped in religious fatalism—seeing this world as “vale of tears”  
	- But that from the 15th century on, Europe began to shed this ideology of renunciation for a belief in the infinite potential of human agency  
		- Insisting that “only in the West” does one find a spirit of...  
- Yet begs the question: Was the rest of the world EVER mired in the same type of   religious dogmatism that had paralyzed medieval Europe?  

Sources of this Myth of European Exceptionalism  
- 19th century European historians attributing the largely uncontested global supremacy of European imperialism to some “inherent historical necessity”  
- Denial of “Coevalness”  
	- Assumption that historical change does not factor into other cultures’ past  
- Diffusionist Theory—West “pulled” other cultures out of their static past  

How Historical Perspective Impacts the Future  
- If we take a more objective and inclusive view of what the world was like before European colonial hegemony  
- If we “begin the story early enough” as Janet Abu-Lughod puts it, it makes all the difference  

## Explanations for “The Rise of the West”  

David Buck’s “Was it Pluck or Luck that Made the West Grow Rich?”  
- “Pluck” as in the instinct, knack, or propensity inherent in European culture that propelled the West to economic prominence by the 18th century  
- "Luck” as in unanticipated, non-premeditated global contingencies, accidents,   serendipity that allowed the West to stumble upon its good fortune  

David Landes’s “European Exceptionalism” argument  
- “Rise of the West” due to Europe’s unique cultural heritage  
- Europe had all the characteristics of an “inventive” civilization  
	- Risk-taking, entrepreneurial spirit, worldly rationality  

Andre Gunder Frank “Historical Discontinuity” argument  
- Europe’s success represents an anomaly in its political and economic evolution  
- More a “discontinuity” than a pre-ordained “inevitability”  

R. Bin Wong’s “Separate Trajectories” argument  
- No shared or universal “meta-narrative” for what “progress” means
	- Important to “go beyond asking European-derived questions,” such as “Why did China fail where Europe succeeded?”  
- Contingency, Accident, Conjuncture  
	- Contingency: Every new phenomenon is conditioned by earlier developments  
	- Accidents: Unpredictable events beyond short term human control  
	- Conjuncture: Independent local developments collide or intersect to shape the course of history
