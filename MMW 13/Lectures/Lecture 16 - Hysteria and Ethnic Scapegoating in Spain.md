Key Questions:
1)     What impact did the Black Death have on the legacy of anti-Semitism in Europe?
2)     How did anti-Semitism intensify in Spain between the 14th and 17th centuries?

## Anti-Semitism and the Black Plague
Outbreak of Pogroms—organized mob attacks on Jews
-  Coincided with the plague’s arrival in southern France and Spain in 1348
- Christian mobs invading the “Aljamas” or Jewish enclaves

Royal Response in Spain
- King Pedro IV condemned these anti-Semitic pogroms as “diabolical”
- Why was this a symbolic rebuke at best?
- To what extent was the violence culturally sanctioned?  To what extent did the authorities turn a blind eye?

## The Black Death as “Watershed” in European Anti-Semitism

Turning Point for Jewish-Christian Relations?
- Simply isolated, brief episodes of persecution—no “paradigm shift”?
- Or did anti-Semitism gain a “normative” foundation in Europe?

Anti-Semitism in Pre-modern Europe
- The Effect of the Crusades starting in 1096
- Why Pick on the Jews?
	- Growing wealth and clout of some Jews in the financial sector
	- By 12th century, sanctioned harassment and extortion commonplace
		- E.g. Ritual of striking a Jew on Easter Sunday in front of a church
- Many royals and nobles competed for jurisdiction over Jewish subjects
	- Nurtured a “patronage” relationship between Jews and Crown
	- As “wards” of the king, Jews very vulnerable to persecution and expulsion
		- First major expulsion was in 1184 in Bavaria
- Convenient and _conspicuous_ target
	- Overall, subject to “the whims of the rulers, prejudices of the populace, and the objections of the clergy” (Boase 3)
	-  For Jews in Spain, persecution culminated in their expulsion in 1492

## The Persecution of Moors in Spain
Domestic “Crusade” against Islam
- By 1499, men like Cardinal Cisneros ordering mass conversions and burning of books in Arabic, including treasured copies of the Qur’an
- King Phillip II again banned use of Arabic in public and Moorish customs in 1567
	 - Insurrections of the Alpujarras in 1499 and 1568
- By the early 1500s, waves of forced conversions
	- Many “conversos” had no choice but to live a double life
	- Issuing of the Taqiyyah

Catch-22 for “_conversos_”
- As “new Christians,” now subject to the Inquisition
	- Victims of “el agradable holocausto”—“agreeable holocaust” of burnt offering
- From “Moro” to “Morisco” or “little Moor”
	- Target of “slanderous anecdotes, insulting remarks, distortions,” such as propensity for pride, avarice, promiscuity, cunning, etc. (Boase 5)

Expulsion 1609-1614
- Estimate of Moors in Spain in early 17th century—600,000
- Arguments made by the likes of Archbishop Juan de Ribera
	-  Moors licentious by nature, highly susceptible to “sins of the flesh”
	- Smear campaign led to the eviction of Moors from many cities
	- Muslim refugees and asylum seekers seldom given warm welcome anywhere
- Overall, as many as 2/3rd of Spanish Moors perished as a result of the expulsion
